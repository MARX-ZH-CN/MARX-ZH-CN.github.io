<h4>London, 14 September 1868<br>
1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</h4>
<p>Dear Meyer,</p>
<p>Enclosed the issue of <em>The Times </em>containing the 4th <strong>Annual Report</strong> of the <strong>General Council</strong> (written by <em>me</em>)<em>, </em>and the very interesting <em>Times </em><strong>first leader</strong><em> </em>on this document. This is the first time that it has abandoned its tone of <em>moquerie </em>about the working class, and taken it ‘verry’ <em>au sérieux. </em>Spread this around. Inform Jessup of this.</p>
<p>I must reply to both your letters, the first to me and the 2nd to Eccarius, which was handed me in his absence (he has not yet returned from Brussels).</p>
<p>As far as the first letter is concerned, it is your fault if <em>Sorge </em>(who is <em>completely unknown </em>to me) has received credentials. If you wanted simply to give him a recommendation for a particular purpose, you should have written so clearly. The way you put it in your letter, I believed that Sorge was <em>your and A. Vogt’s man</em>. So be more careful in future. Then you made the second mistake of <em>giving </em>the credentials to Sorge, instead of writing to me first about the misunderstanding!</p>
<p>The mistake has been made, but it is not irreparable.</p>
<p>The Brussels Congress has once again allotted the General Council to London. But it is now to be regarded as a <em>new </em><strong>Council</strong>, which <em>revises </em>all <em>old </em>credentials. So write to me whether you and A. Vogt want credentials. Write, too, <em>in which manner </em>we should withdraw Sorge’s credentials or, alternatively, inform him that the new General Council has changed the credentials. </p>
<p>Drury was here for a while. Recently, shortly before the Brussels Congress, he was <em>proposed </em>as authorised agent of the <strong>International Workingmen’s Association</strong> to the <strong>American Labor Union</strong> and its congress. We <em>did not agree to this at the time, </em>since the source of the suggestion appeared suspicious to us. Please observe the man more closely first, either yourself or through friends.</p>
<p>No <strong>copies</strong> remain of the <em>Commonwealth </em><strong>paper</strong>. For the past few years there have <em>not </em>been any <em>agitational </em>writings in our sense in England. My <em>book has not yet been translated into English. </em>Eccarius, otherwise very capable, but at the same time very <strong>ambitious</strong>, has <em>intentionally not mentioned it </em>in <em>The Commonwealth </em>or at other opportunities. He likes to appropriate my propositions <em>for himself. </em>At the congress in Brussels, Lessner mentioned <em>my book </em>in his speech about machinery. The correspondent of <em>The Daily News </em>reported this. Eccarius, who reported the congress sessions for <em>The Times</em>, suppressed it. His conduct is all the more absurd since he owes me not only his knowledge, but also his post as general secretary on the <strong>General Council</strong>. I alone supported him (at <em>The Commonwealth </em>too) against attacks by the English and French. He relies upon the experience he already has with me, that I am only concerned with the cause, and ignore personal stupidities!</p>
<p>I shall <em>not </em>give him your letter.</p>
<p>The more English excerpts from my book you can get into the American press the better.</p>
<p>Send them to me!</p>
<p>I attach the enclosed card. It was sent to us, with a letter, to establish contact with us. Address: G. W. Randall, <strong>Secretary, Workingmen’s Institute</strong>, 3 Tremont Row, Room 52, <em>Boston </em>N. E.</p>
<p>I lost contact years ago with all my acquaintances in America. I am still in touch only with Meyer in St. Louis, the friend of our J. Weydemeyer (deceased last year).</p>
<p>Write me all you can find out about the relationship between the railways and real estate.</p>
<p>You may have seen that, at its congress in Hamburg, the General Association of German Workers passed a special resolution giving recognition to my book.</p>
<p>Write to Randall on my behalf as <strong>German Secretary </strong>of the<strong> General Council</strong>.</p>
<p>Best greetings to A. Vogt and yourself.</p>
<p class="sig">Yours<br>
K. Marx</p>
<p>I am sending 2 copies of <em>The Times, </em>one for you, the other for Jessup.</p>
