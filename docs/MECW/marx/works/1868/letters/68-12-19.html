<h4>London, 19 December 1868</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Thanks</strong> for your marginal notes! When I wrote to you that evening I was excited. But the next morning there was already a reaction and the decision to treat the matter diplomatically, quite as you advise.</p>
<p>Ténot’s <em>Province </em>is much better. It contains many new details for us. Had the Parisians held out a couple of days longer, the <em>Empire </em>would have been <em>foutu</em>. <span class="context">[finished]</span> The movement (republican) among the rural population was much bigger than we knew.</p>
<p>Enclosed <em>Réveil, </em>the organ of Ledru-Rollin. Delescluze his <em>ame damnée, républicain de vieille roche, asinus. </em>He is the provisional government’s commissioner who led the Belgians into the <em>guet-àpens </em>of Risquons Tout. Thus traitor or arch-<strong>ass</strong>. Probably the latter.</p>
<p>The stupid idea of the workers who wanted to give a banquet for <span class="context">[U.S. Ambassador in London]</span> R. Johnson has been blocked <em>by us. </em>Coningsby, whose initiative it was, is a blackguard. This character was on a <strong>pleasure trip to the United States</strong> and was paid by Seward for this London reception for R. Johnson. He is the same <strong>workman</strong> who wrote to <em>The Times </em>years ago, stating that the workers were politically satisfied and <strong>did not want the suffrage</strong>.</p>
<p>If you could send me a few £ for the Christmas week now beginning, it would be very welcome. </p>
<p><em>Salut</em>.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
