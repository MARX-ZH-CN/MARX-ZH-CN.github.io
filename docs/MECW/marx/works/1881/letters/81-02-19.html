<h4>London, February 19, 1881</h4>
<p class="fst">
I have read with the greatest interest your article, which is in the best sense of the word “original.”  Hence the boycotting – if you break through the webs of routine thought, you are
always sure to be “boycotted”  in the first instance; it is the only arm of defence which in their first perplexity the routiniers know how to wield. I have been “boycotted”  in Germany for many, many years, and am still so in England, with that little variation that from time to time something so absurd and asinine is launched against me that I would blush to take any public notice of it. But try on! The next thing to do – in my opinion – is to take up the wonderfully increasing <em>indebtedness of the landlords,</em> the upper-class representatives of agriculture, and show them how they are “crystallised”  in the retort under the control of the “new pillars of society.”</p>
<p>
I am very anxious to see your polemics with the “<em>Slovo.</em>” As soon as I shall sail in more quiet waters I shall enter more fully upon your <em>Esquisse</em> [sketch]. For the present I cannot omit one observation. The soil being exhausted and getting not the elements – by artificial and vegetable and animal manure, etc.  – to supply its wants, will, with the changing favour of the seasons, of circumstances independent of human influence – still continue to yield harvests of very different amounts, though, summing up a period of years, as for instance, from 1870-80, the stagnant character of the production presents itself in the most striking character. Under such circumstances the favourable climatic conditions pave the way to a <em>famine year</em> by quickly consuming and setting free the mineral fertilisers still potent on the soil, while vice-versa, a <em>famine-year,</em> and still more a series of bad years following it, allow the soil-inherent minerals to accumulate anew, and to work efficiently with returning favour of the climatic conditions. Such a process goes, of course,
everywhere on, but <em>elsewhere</em> it is checked by the modifying intervention of the agriculturist himself. It becomes the only <em>regulating factor</em> where man has ceased to be a “power”  – for want of means.</p>
<p>
So we have 1870 as an excellent harvest in your country, but that year is a <em>climax year,</em> and as such immediately followed by a very bad one; the year 1871, the very bad harvest, must be considered as the starting point for a new little cycle, till we come to the new climax year 1874, which is immediately followed by the famine year 1875; then the upwards movement begins again, ending in the still worse famine year 1880. The summing up of the years during the whole period proves that the average annual production remained the same and that the mere natural factors have alone produced the changes, comparing the single years and the smaller cycles of years.</p>
<p>I wrote you some time ago, that if the great industrial and commercial crisis England has passed through, went over without the culminating financial crash at London, this <em>exceptional</em> phenomenon was only due to French money. This is now seen and acknowledged even by English <em>routiniers.</em> Thus the <em>Statist</em> (January 19, 1881) says: “The money market has only be[en] so easy as it has been during the past years <em>through an accident.</em> The <em>Bank of France</em> in the early autumn permitted its stock of
gold bullion to fall from £30 millions to £22 millions .... <em>Last autumn undoubtedly there was a very narrow escape.</em>” (!) </p>
<p>
The <em>English railway system</em> rolls on the same inclined plane as the European Public Debt system. The ruling magnates amongst the different railway-nets directors contract not only – progressively – new loans <em>in order to enlarge their network,</em> i.e., the ”  territory,”  where they rule as absolute monarchs, but they enlarge their respective networks <em>in order to have</em> new pretexts <em>for engaging in new loans</em> which enable them to pay the interest due to the holders of obligations, preferential shares, etc., and also from time to time to throw a sop to the much ill-used common shareholders in the shape of somewhat increased dividends.  This pleasant method must one day or another terminate in an ugly catastrophe.</p>
<p>In the United States the railway kings have become the butt of attacks, not only, as before this, on the part of the farmers and other industrial “<em>entrepreneurs</em>”  of the <em>West,</em> but also on the part of the grand representative of commerce – the <em>New York Chamber of Commerce</em>.  The Octopodus railway king and financial swindler <em>Gould</em> has, on his side, told the New York commercial magnates: You now attack the railways, because you think them most vulnerable considering their present unpopularity; but take heed: after the railways <em>every sort of corporation</em> (means in the Yankee dialect joint stock company) will have its turn; then, later on, all forms of associated capital; finally <em>all forms of capital;</em> you are thus paving the way to – <em>Communism</em> whose tendencies are already more and more spreading among the people. M. Gould “<em>a le flair bon.</em>”</p>
<p>
In <em>India</em> serious complications, if not a general outbreak, is in store for the British government.  What the English take from them annually in the form of rent, dividends for railways useless to the Hindus;  pensions for military and civil service men, for Afghanistan and other wars, etc., etc. – what they take from them <em>without any equivalent</em> and quite apart from what they appropriate to themselves annually <em>within</em> India, speaking only of the <em>value of the commodities</em> the Indians have gratuitously and annually to <em>send over</em> to England – it amounts to <em>more than the total sum of income of the sixty millions of agricultural and industrial labourers of India!</em> This is a bleeding process, with a vengeance! The famine years are pressing each other and in dimensions till now not yet suspected in Europe! There is an actual conspiracy going on wherein Hindus and Mussulmans co-operate; the British government is aware that something is “brewing,”   but this shallow people (I mean the governmental men), stultified by their own parliamentary ways of talking and thinking, do not even desire to see clear, to realise the whole extent of the imminent danger! To delude others and by deluding them to delude yourself – this is: <em>parliamentary wisdom</em> in a nutshell! <em>Tant mieux!</em></p>
