<h4>London, 10 December 1869</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p><em> D'abord, </em>about the Solingen business. (Are £2 necessary here?  I think only one.)</p>
<p>These people have <strong>bothered</strong> me, the <strong>General Council</strong>, the <em>Basle Congress </em>etc., with their <strong>appeals</strong>. They themselves admit that their productive cooperative is only of <em>local </em>interest. How can they expect foreign countries to contribute a <strong>single farthing</strong> to them, in view of the <em>international </em>sacrifices that the <strong>strikes</strong>, etc., cost, and of the tribulations of hundreds of French and English production cooperatives? They have seen what benefit they have gained from <em>Becker’s enthusiastic appeals.</em></p>
<p>On the other hand: these Solingen people are supporters for you <em>and me </em>in the Rhine Province. They belonged (<strong>the leaders</strong>) to the League. Under Lassalle’s lordly sway, when Marquis Izzy <span class="context">[Lassalle]</span> was in Cologne, the same Karl Klein announced a <strong>toast</strong> for us, the editors of the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung, </em>and Izzy was forced <em>de faire bonne mine à mauvais jeu</em> <span class="context">[grin and bear it]</span>. Further, their cooperative was solid and maintained itself for years. The stupidity of the Prussian legislation forced them to fix their capital and thus reduce their <em>working capital. </em>Then the Rhenish bourgeois became irritable and decided to break them up, partly <em>by selling their </em><strong>obligations</strong><em>, </em>and partly by <em>withdrawing all </em><strong>commercial advances</strong> (not based on <strong>obligations</strong>).</p>
<p>Thus, the business is of general importance and, for us, personal importance.</p>
<p>What I suggest is this:</p>
<p>You send the fellows 50 thaler for <strong>obligations</strong>, and tell them, at the same time, that they must themselves see you can do <em>nothing </em>for them among the English bourgeois in Manchester. Tell them as well — and this is a <strong>fact</strong> — that I in London have made <em>all possible efforts on their behalf, but in vain. </em>Finally, tell them — and I shall try this <em>immediately — </em>that I shall try to raise money for them among the <em>German bourgeois </em>I shall — naturally you will <em>not </em>tell them this — write immediately to Menke in Hamburg to this end. It is possible that Menke (who is a millionaire, and has read <em>Capital </em>from beginning to end, and furnished it with ‘correcting notes’, which he himself showed me) will do something. 2,000 thaler are nothing to such people. They would naturally, <em>d'abord, </em><strong>send somebody to</strong> Solingen to look at how the thing works. If the business is <em>not capable of surviving, </em>it <em>should not and may not </em>receive support. If the contrary, then I <em>am certain </em>that these people (Menke <em>et Co</em>.) will provide the money.</p>
<p><em>Ad voce</em>: <strong>Irish question</strong><em>. </em>I did not attend the <strong>Central Council</strong> last Tuesday. My ‘<strong>family’ </strong>did not allow me to go in this <strong>fog</strong> and in <strong>my present state of health</strong>, although I had undertaken <strong>to open the debates</strong>.</p>
<p>With regard to the report in the <em>National Reformer, </em>not only has nonsense been attributed to me, but even what is <em>rightly </em>reported is <em>incorrectly </em>reported. But I didn’t want to complain. <em>D’abord</em>, I would, thereby, offend the <strong>reporter</strong> (Harris). Second, as long as I don’t interfere, all these reports are in no way official. If I correct something, I admit the rest is right — yet everything is wrong the way it is reproduced. <strong>Besides</strong>, I <em>have reasons </em>not to convert these reports into legal <strong>evidence</strong><em> against </em>me, which happens the moment I correct details<a name="ireland">.</a></p>
<p>The way I shall express the matter next Tuesday is: that, quite apart from all ‘international’ and ‘humane’ phrases about <strong>Justice for Ireland</strong> — which are taken for granted on the <strong>International Council</strong> — it is in <em>the direct and absolute interests of the </em><strong>English working class to get rid of their present connexion with Ireland</strong>. I am fully convinced of this, for reasons that, in part, I cannot tell the English workers themselves. For a long time I believed it would be possible to overthrow the Irish regime by <strong>English working class ascendancy</strong>. I always took this viewpoint in the <em>New-York Tribune. </em>Deeper study has now convinced me of the opposite. The English <strong>working class</strong> <em>will never accomplish </em>anything <strong>before it has got rid of Ireland</strong>. The lever must be applied in Ireland. This is why the Irish <strong>question</strong> is so important for the social movement in general.</p>
<p>I have read a lot of <em>Davies</em> in extracts. The book itself I have only glanced through superficially in the Museum, so you would oblige me if you would copy out for me the passages relating to <strong>common property</strong>. You must get hold of Curran’s ‘<em>Speeches’ edited by Davies </em>(<em>London: </em>James Duffy, 22 Paternoster Row). I meant to give it to you when you were in London. It is now circulating among the English <strong>members of the Central Council</strong>, and God knows when I shall see it again. For the period 1779-1800 (Union) it is of decisive importance, not only because of Curran’s ‘<em>Speeches’ </em>(namely in court; I regard Curran as the <em>sole </em>great lawyer (people’s advocate) of the 18th century, and the <em>noblest personality, while </em>Grattan was a parliamentary rogue), but because you find all <em>the </em>sources about the <strong>United Irishmen</strong><em>. </em>This period is of the greatest interest, <strong>scientifically and dramatically</strong>. First, the dirty infamies of the English in 1588-89 repeated (perhaps even intensified) in 1788-89. Second, class movement is easily shown in the Irish movement itself. Third, the infamous policy of Pitt. <em>Fourth, which </em>very much irks Messrs the English, the proof that Ireland came to grief because <strong>in fact, from a revolutionary standpoint</strong>, <em>the </em>Irish <em>were too </em>far advanced for the <strong>English King and Church mob</strong><em>, </em>while, on the other hand, English reaction in England (as in Cromwell’s time) had its roots in the subjugation of Ireland. This period must be described in at least one chapter: a pillory for John Bull!</p>
<p>Enclosed something French — and, as a contrast, Freiligrath-ish!</p>
<p>I would be glad if you would send the money for the next quarter as soon as <em>possible.</em></p>
<p><em>Apropos</em>. Tussy has undertaken <strong>a foolish work</strong>, embroidering a sofa cushion for you for Christmas. I don’t believe she will be finished, before the New Year. She allows neither Mama, nor Jennychen, nor Lenchen to sew a single stitch, so she has done <em>nothing else </em>for weeks. This is, however, a great secret, and you must naturally not give <em>the slightest </em>hint that you know about it. Tussy would eat me alive.</p>
<p><strong>Compliments to Mrs</strong> Lizzy.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. Moor</p>
<p>Of the French stuff I am sending you, Gaulois — half Bonapartist, half opposition — is <strong>stupid</strong>. <em>Père Duchèsne will </em>astonish you by its impudence. And in such a <strong>state of things</strong> the bitch Eugénie dares to push herself forward ... ? She really wants to get hanged.</p>
<p>Apropos. The translation of <em>Capital</em> <strong>goes on</strong>. Keller has now interrupted it, however. He wants to publish <em>18th Brumaire </em>first, believing this possible under the present circumstances and important for France.</p>
<p>As for the current <em>Irish movement</em>, 3 important factors: 1. opposition to lawyers and <strong>trading politicians</strong> and <strong>Blarney</strong>; 2. opposition to the dictates of the priests who (<em>the higher ones</em>) are <strong>traitors</strong>, as in O'Connell’s time, just as in 1798-1800; 3. the emergence of the <strong>agricultural labouring class</strong> against the <strong>farming class on the last meetings</strong>. (Similar phenomenon from 1795 to 1800.)</p>
<p>The <em>Irishman </em>only made its way owing to the suppression of the <strong>Fenian Press</strong>. For a long time it stood <strong>in opposition to</strong><em> </em>Fenianism. Luby, etc., <strong>of the</strong> <em>Irish People </em>were educated people who treated religion as a bagatelle. The government cast them into prison, and then came the Pigotts <em>et Co. </em>The <em>Irishman </em>will only continue to amount to anything until those people come out of prison. He knows this, though he is now squeezing <strong>political capital</strong><em> </em>out of declarations on behalf of the ‘<strong>felon convicts’.</strong></p>
