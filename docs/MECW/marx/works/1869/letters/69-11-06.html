<h4>London, 6 November 1869</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>I send you 1 <em>Pionier, </em>1 <em>Volksstaat, </em>and various copies of <em>Social-Demokrat.</em></p>
<p>You will see from the <em>Pionier </em>that Heinzen believes I only wrote <em>Capital </em>so that <em>he </em>should not understand it.</p>
<p>Schweitzer — utilising Liebknecht’s anxiety with regard to his democratic friends — is behaving as though polemics against landed property were the first word in the Lassallean creed! <em>Quelle impudence! </em>Incidentally, Bonhorst did him good service in an issue of the <em>Volksstaat </em>that I cannot find. I don’t know whether you receive the <em>Volksstaat.</em></p>
<p>Bonhorst’s arrest is good.</p>
<p>There could be nothing more ridiculous than the respectable people’s fear concerning the Queen’s procession today. Everywhere overrun by police as in France. The whole alarm was produced by a <strong>hoax</strong>. A few agitators have had their fun in the past few weeks, circulating <strong>handbills</strong> calling on the starving workers of the East End to present themselves <em>en masse </em>to the Queen, and <em>de ne pas laisser passer la reine</em> <span class="context">[not let the Queen pass]</span>.</p>
<p>My family has just returned from the spectacle. Icy coldness amongst the public. Madame is said to have stared fuming-mad and ultra-crabby<a name="ireland">.</a></p>
<p>I shall send you, in the next few days, a volume I happened to pick up, which contains all sorts of pamphlets on Ireland. Those by Ensor (whom I also quoted in <em>Capital</em>) contain many piquant points. Ensor was a political economist of English origin (his father still lived in England when Ensor was born), Protestant and, despite all this, one of the most resolute <strong>Repealers</strong> before 1830. Being himself indifferent to religious things, he can defend Catholicism with wit against the Protestants. The first pamphlet in the book is by Arthur O’Connor. I had expected rather more of it, since this O’Connor played an important role in 1798, and I have found good articles by him about Castlereagh’s administration in Cobbett’s <em>Political Register. Tussy </em>should sometime look through Cobbett, for something there about Ireland.</p>
<p>This week Tussy and I lost 3 days putting my workroom in order. It had become jumbled to the frontiers of possibility.</p>
<p><em>Salut.</em></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>Tussy <strong>sends her best compliments to the family</strong>.</p>
