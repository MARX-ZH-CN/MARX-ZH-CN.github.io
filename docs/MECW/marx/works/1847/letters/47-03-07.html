<h4>Brussels, 7 March 1847</h4>
<p>Dear Daniels,</p>
<p><em>You or one of the others in Cologne</em> may get a letter from Hess about communist affairs. I would urgently ask that <em>none</em> of <em>you</em> should answer until I have provided you with documents and letters through W <span class="context">[probably Georg Weerth or Joseph Weydemeyer]</span>. At all events, I must again <em>urgently</em> request you to <em>come here. </em>I have some important things to tell you which cannot be communicated by post. If <em>you </em>can’t come, then H. Bürgers must spend a few days here. You or your representative will stay with me .... <span class="context">[remainder of the letter is missing, save for the next sentences, which are written in the margin. After the words ‘with me’ Marx added ‘see above']</span></p>
<p>So either you or H. Bürgers come to <em>Malines</em> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Forward the enclosed letter to <em>Zulauff</em>,<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#145" target=_blank>[145]</a></sup> Grünstrasse, Elberfeld.</p>
<p>Do not come to <em>Brussels</em> but to <em>Malines</em> and write the day before to say when you or Bürgers are coming.</p>
<p>You can neglect your bourgeois affairs for a day or two.</p>
<p>Your<br>
Marx</p>
