<h4>[London,] 2 February 1859 </h4>
<p><strong>Dear</strong> Frederick,</p>
<p>The <em>Constitutionnel</em> wins since, according to <em>The Times</em>, the author was none other than Mr Boustrapa.</p>
<p>Today came a letter (which I'll send you later) from Lassalle saying that the manuscript has <em>not yet</em> arrived. Now take note: It went off on Tuesday (25); I was notified as early as <em>30th</em> January by the <strong>packet company</strong> here that the manuscript had arrived in Berlin. Lassalle’s letter is dated 31 January. <em>Hence</em> the government has been <em>holding back</em> my manuscript for 3 or 4 days at least (if Duncker got the manuscript <em>after</em> Lassalle’s letter went off). Maybe Mr Stieber has been rummaging through it, or Mr von Patow has been endeavouring to make a hasty acquaintance with economics.</p>
<p>Wrote to Lassalle straight off. <em>Your philistines</em> have intercepted the stuff you were sending me (for Tuesday). It didn’t arrive. I waited until 3 in the afternoon. Then I dashed off another article.</p>
<p><em>Salut</em>.</p>
