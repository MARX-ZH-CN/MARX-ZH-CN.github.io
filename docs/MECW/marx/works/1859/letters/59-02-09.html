<h4>[London,] 9 February 1859 </h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>At last a letter from Duncker <em>today. </em>He didn’t receive the manuscript <span class="context">[<em>Contribution to Critique of Political Economy</em>]</span> until 1 February. Not printed this week, because just completing some work or other — I don’t know which — of Lassalle’s.</p>
<p>Enclosed a letter from Eccarius and Pfänder from which you will see that poor Eccarius is down with consumption. This is the most tragic thing I have yet experienced here in London.</p>
<p>Pieper, who had been discharged as cured, is back from Bognor again and in the German hospital. This time starvation treatment. <strong>Serves him right</strong>.</p>
<p>I meant to send you the enclosed letters from Weydemeyer and Komp long ago. I have at last replied to them.</p>
<p>Dronke has been to Bonn, where one of his brothers was dying. Having obtained Flottwell’s permission, he attended a ball given by his [students'] ‘corps’ in Bonn. The little man <span class="context">[Dronke]</span> has written to Dingelstedt (<em>of Fulda</em>), through whom he hopes to arrange a performance of a <em>play</em> he himself has written. In addition, the little man writes ‘Glasgower Briefe’ for Prutz’s <em>Museum</em>. I had all this news from philistine Freiligrath.</p>
<p>From the latter, who came to see me yesterday (I myself being confined to the house with a bad throat), I also learned that Gottfried’s — or Hermann’s — behaviour towards ladies is invariably so ludicrous (the buffoon now supposes he need only throw down his handkerchief) that he has become an object of general <em>dégoût.</em> Moreover, Freiligrath has now also tumbled to the fact that Gottfried feels exceptionally ‘<strong>free and easy’ </strong>now that the Mockel woman is dead and  — strangest of all — <em>it now transpires</em> that, even <em>before the day of the funeral</em>, philistine Freiligrath and wife had discovered brother Hermann’s ‘lack of concern’.</p>
<p>According to Gottfried, the <em>Hermann</em>, to which the Prussian government has, as the Berlin <em>National-Zeitung</em> announces, granted a licence for postal distribution, is to cover the ‘<em>loss</em>’ to his funds occasioned by his wife’s death.</p>
<p>In due course, no doubt, Mrs Daniels will become Mrs Bürgers. She has written to Lina saying that ‘Bürgers has grown <em>still more</em> energetic and self-confident’. In proof of that ‘self-confidence’ she writes, ‘we are delighted by Freiligrath’s poem about Mrs Kinkel, which was mutilated by the “perfidious” <em>Kölnische Zeitung</em>’.</p>
<p>Steffen has written to Freiligrath asking for your address and mine as he has lost them. Steffen’s address is: <em>W. Steffen, Harrison Square near Boston, Mass. U. St.</em></p>
<p><em>Salut</em>.</p>
