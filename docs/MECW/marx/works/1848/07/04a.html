<p><em>Cologne, </em>July 3. Up to now the Government of <em>Action</em> has only proved itself as the Ministry of the Police. Its first act was the arrest of Herr <em>Monecke </em>and Herr <em>Fernbach</em> in Berlin. Its second act was the arrest of Bombardier <em>Funk</em> in Saarlouis. Now “action” is beginning to make itself felt here in Cologne too. This morning Dr. <em>Gottschalk</em> and Lieutenant (ret.) <em>Anneke</em> were arrested. We are reserving our judgment since we are still lacking definite information about the reasons for their arrest and the manner in which it was carried out.</p>
<p>The workers will be sensible enough not to let themselves he provoked into creating a disturbance.</p>
