<p><em>Cologne, </em>November 28. In its issue of November 17 the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> stated:</p>
<p>“And as for the <em>Jews, </em>who since the emancipation of their sect have everywhere put themselves, at least in the person of their eminent representatives, at the <em>head of the counter-revolution</em> — what awaits them? There has been no waiting for victory in order to throw them back into their ghetto.” </p>
<p>At the time, we quoted government decrees from <em>Bromberg</em>. Today we have a still more striking fact to report. The big “Three Crowns” masonic lodge in Berlin — it is well known that the <em>Prince of Prussia</em> is the supreme head of the Prussian freemasons, just as <em>Frederick William IV</em> is the supreme head of the Prussian religion — has put a stop to the activity of the <em>Minerva</em> lodge in Cologne. Why? <em>Because</em> <em>it has Jews among </em>its <em>members. Let the Jews take note of this!</em> </p>
<p>A circular of the Brandenburg Ministry to all administrative bodies, which we came upon by chance, calls upon them to carry out <em>mass arrests of the leaders of the clubs.</em> </p>
<p>We are assured from a trustworthy source that <em>Cologne, Düsseldorf,</em> <em>Aachen etc. </em>will be given imperial troops, in fact <em>Austrians</em>, as a Christmas present from our most gracious sovereign. Probably they will include <em>Croats, Serezhans, Czechs, Raizes, Serbs etc.,</em><sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#112" target=_blank>[112]</a></sup> so that “order and calm” will be established in the Rhine Province as in Vienna. By the way, people say that the Rhine Province borders not on <em>Russia</em> but on <em>France</em>. <em>Let the most gracious sovereign take note of this!</em></p>
