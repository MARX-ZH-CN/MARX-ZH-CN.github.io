<p class="fst"><em>E. Girardin</em> is pitiable in his apologia for the imperialistic cretin <em>Louis Napoleon</em>, the “<em>little constable</em>” <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#38" target=_blank>[38]</a></sup> ; he is likeable in his attacks on <em>Cavaignac</em>, the warrior hero of M. Marrast. Since November 7 he has been publishing in consecutive issues a philippic against the <em>hero of the European bourgeoisie</em>, which has fallen in love with his Arabian nightcap. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#39" target=_blank>[39]</a></sup> Perfidious as this bourgeoisie is, it has sacrificed him to the <em>Sipehsalar </em><span class="context">[supreme commander]</span><em> Jellachich, </em>who is now the <em>lion</em> of the European hucksters.</p>
<p>We give our readers in full the <em>acte d'accusation</em> made by <em>La Presse. </em>In contrast to all European newspapers of great or small format, we have conceived the <em>June revolution</em> in a way that history has confirmed. We insist on coming back from time to time to its chief factors and chief <em>dramatis personae</em>, since the <em>June revolution is the centre</em> around which the European revolution and counter-revolution revolve. The distance from the June revolution, as we stated at the time when it was taking place, marked the zenith of counter-revolution, which had to make its tour of Europe. The return to the June revolution is the real beginning of the European revolution. Therefore, back to <em>Cavaignac</em>, to the <em>inventor of the state of siege.</em></p>
