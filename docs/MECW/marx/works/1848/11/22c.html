<p class="fst"><em>Cologne</em>, November 21. In Berlin the Public Prosecutor’s office has capitulated to a <em>traitor to the state. </em>The Chief Public Prosecutor, Herr Sethe, instead of complying with the National Assembly’s demand that he should do his duty in respect of the traitor Brandenburg, has resigned.</p>
<p>The Rhenish District Committee of Democrats, which is endeavouring to make the legal decision of the National Assembly as widely known as possible, and which therefore demands that the plans of a <em>traitor to the state </em>should be frustrated,’ is being prosecuted by the Cologne Public Prosecutor on a charge of — <em>rebellion </em>(?!).</p>
<p>“He who has might, has right.” — The representatives of the <em>right</em> are everywhere on the side of <em>might.</em></p>
