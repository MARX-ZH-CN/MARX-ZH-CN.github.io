<h4>Neue Rheinische Zeitung No. 141, November 12, 1848</h4>
<p class="fst"><em>Cologne</em>, November 11. The <em>Pfuel Ministry</em> was a “ <em>misunderstanding</em>”; its real meaning is the <em>Brandenburg Ministry</em>. The Pfuel Ministry was the <em>table of contents, </em>the Brandenburg Ministry is the <em>content</em> itself.</p>
<p><em>Brandenburg in the Assembly and the Assembly in Brandenburg</em>. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#17" target=_blank>[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p><b>Thus runs the epitaph of the House of Brandenburg</b>. <span class="context">[the Hohenzollerns, hereditary margraves of Brandenburg since 1417]</span></p>
<p>The Emperor Charles V was admired because he had himself buried while still alive. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#18" target=_blank>[18]</a></sup> To have a bad joke engraved on one’s tombstone is to go one better than the Emperor Charles V and his penal system, his criminal code.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#19" target=_blank>[19]</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Brandenburg in the Assembly and the Assembly in Brandenburg!</em></p>
<p>A King of Prussia once put in an appearance in the Assembly. That was not the real Brandenburg. The Marquis of Brandenburg who appeared in the Assembly the day before yesterday was the real King of Prussia.</p>
<p>The guardroom in the Assembly, the Assembly in the guardroom — that means: <em>Brandenburg in the Assembly, the Assembly in Brandenburg!</em></p>
<p>Or will the <em>Assembly in Brandenburg</em> — Berlin, as is cell known, is situated in the Province of Brandenburg — be master ... of the <em>Brandenburg in the Assembly? </em>Will Brandenburg seek the protection of the Assembly as a Capet once did in another Assembly?<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#20" target=_blank>[20]</a></sup></p>
<p><b>Brandenburg in the Assembly and the Assembly in Brandenburg</b> is an expression with many meanings, ambiguous and portentous.</p>
<p>As we know, it is much easier for the peoples to cope with <em>kings</em> than with <em>legislative assemblies. </em>History gives us a whole list of abortive revolts of the people against national assemblies. It knows only two important exceptions to this rule. The English people in the person of <em>Cromwell</em> dissolved the <em>Long Parliament</em>, and the French people in the person of <em>Bonaparte</em> dissolved the <em>Corps legislatif. </em>But the Long Parliament had long ago become a <em>Rump</em>, and the <em>Corps legislatif </em>a <em>corpse.</em></p>
<p>Are the kings more fortunate than the peoples in their <em>revolts</em> <em>against legislative assemblies?</em></p>
<p><em>Charles I, James II, Louis XVI</em> and <em>Charles X </em>are hardly promising ancestral examples.</p>
<p>There are luckier ancestors in <em>Spain</em> and <em>Italy</em> however. And recently in <em>Vienna</em>?</p>
<p>But one must not forget that a <em>Congress of Nations</em> was in session in Vienna and that the <em>representatives of the Slavs, </em>except for the Poles, went over to the imperial camp with bands playing. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#21" target=_blank>[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>The struggle of the camarilla in Vienna against the Imperial Diet was at the same time a struggle of the <em>Slav</em> Diet against the German Diet. It was not <em>Slavs</em>, however, who seceded in the Berlin Assembly, it was only <em>slaves, </em>and slaves do not constitute a party; at best they are camp-followers of a party. The members of the Right who left the Berlin Assembly<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#22" target=_blank>[22]</a></sup> have not strengthened the enemy camp, they have infected it with a fatal malady — with <em>treason</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Slav</em> party <em>was victorious </em>in Austria together with the camarilla. It will now <em>fight</em> the camarilla over the spoils. If the Berlin camarilla is victorious it will not have to share the victory with the <em>Right</em> or to defend it against the <em>Right</em>; the Right will be given a <em>tip</em> — and <em>kicks.</em></p>
<p>The Prussian Crown is within its <em>rights</em> in confronting the Assembly as an <em>absolute Crown</em>. But the Assembly is in the <em>wrong</em> because it does not confront the Crown as an <em>absolute assembly. </em>To begin with it should have had the Ministers <em>arrested</em> as <em>traitors</em>, <em>traitors to the sovereignty of the people</em>. It should have <em>proscribed</em> and <em>outlawed </em>all officials who obey orders others than those of the Assembly.</p>
<p>But the <em>political</em> weakness characterising the actions of the National Assembly in Berlin may become a source of <em>civic</em> strength in the provinces.</p>
<p>The bourgeoisie would have liked so much to transform the <em>feudal monarchy</em> into a <em>bourgeois monarchy</em> in an <em>amicable</em> way. After depriving the feudal party of armorial bearings and titles, which are offensive to its civic pride, and of the dues appertaining to feudal property, which violate the bourgeois mode of appropriation, the bourgeoisie would have liked so much to unite with the feudal party and together with it enslave the people. But the old bureaucracy does not want to be reduced to the status of a servant of a bourgeoisie for whom, until now, it has been a despotic tutor. The feudal party does not want to see its marks of distinction and interests burnt at the altar of the bourgeoisie. Finally, the Crown sees in the elements of the old feudal society — a society of which it is the crowning excrescence — its true, native social ground, whereas it regards the bourgeoisie as an alien, artificial soil which bears it only under the condition that it withers away.</p>
<p>The bourgeoisie turns the intoxicating “<em>grace of God</em>” into a sober <em>legal title, </em>the rule of blood into the rule of paper, the royal sun into a civic astral lamp.</p>
<p>Royalty, therefore, was not taken in by the bourgeoisie. Its reply to the partial revolution of the bourgeoisie was a full-fledged counter-revolution. It drove the bourgeoisie once more into the <em>arms of the revolution</em>, <em>of the people, </em>by crying out to it:</p>
<p><em>Brandenburg in the Assembly and the Assembly in Brandenburg</em>.</p>
<p>While admitting that we do not expect the bourgeoisie to answer in a manner befitting the occasion, we must not omit to remark, on the other hand, that in its rebellion against the National Assembly the Crown, too, resorts to hypocritical half measures and hides its head under the constitutional veil at the very moment when it tries to cast’ off this irksome veil.</p>
<p><em>Brandenburg, makes the German Central Authority</em><sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#23" target=_blank>[23]</a></sup> <em>give </em>him the <em>order</em> for his coup <em>d'état. The regiments of the guards marched into Berlin by order of the Central Authority</em>. The Berlin counter-revolution is carried out by order of the German Central Authority. Brandenburg orders Frankfurt to give him this order. It denies its sovereignty at the very moment when it wants to establish it. Herr Bassermann of course eagerly seized the opportunity to play the servant as master. But he has the satisfaction that the master in his turn plays the servant.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome in Berlin may be, the <em>dilemma</em> is: either the <em>King</em> or the <em>people</em> — and the people will be victorious with the cry, <em>Brandenburg in the Assembly and the Assembly in Brandenburg</em>.</p>
<p>We may have to go through a hard school, but it is the preparatory school for a <b>complete revolution</b>.</p>

<p class="fst">
<b>Cologne, November 11.</b> European revolution is taking a circular
course. It started in Italy and assumed a European character in Paris;
the first repercussion of the February revolution followed in Vienna; the
repercussion of the Viennese revolution took place in Berlin. European
counterrevolution struck its first blow in Italy, at Naples; it assumed
a European character in Paris in June; the first repercussion of the June
counter-revolution followed in Vienna; it comes to a close and discredits
itself in Berlin. The crowing of the Gallic cock in Paris will once again
rouse Europe.</p>
<p>But in Berlin the counter-revolution is bringing itself into disrepute.
Everything becomes disreputable in Berlin, even counter-revolution.</p>
<p>In Naples the lazzaroni are leagued with the monarchy against
the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>In Paris the greatest struggle ever known in history is taking
place. The bourgeoisie is leagued with the lazzaroni against the working
class.</p>
<p>In Vienna we have a flock of nationalities who imagine that the
counter-revolution will bring them emancipation. In addition -- the secret
spite of the bourgeoisie against the workers and the Academic Legion; discord
within the Civil Guard itself; finally, attacks by the people supplying
a pretext for the attacks by the Court.</p>
<p>Nothing like that is happening in Berlin. The bourgeoisie and the people
are on one side and the drill-sergeants on the other.</p>
<p>Wrangel and Brandenburg, two men who have no head, no heart, no
opinions, nothing but moustaches [The term "Schnurrbart" (moustache) in
18 c. student slang stood also for policeman. -- Ed.] -- such is the antithesis
of the querulous, self-opinionated, irresolute National Assembly.</p>
<p>Will-power -- be it even that of an ass, an ox, a policeman --
is all that is needed to tackle the weak-willed grumblers of the March
revolution. And the Prussian Court, which has just as little will-power
as the National Assembly, seeks out the two most stupid men in the monarchy
and tells these lions: represent will-power. Pfuel still had a few grains
of brain. But absolute stupidity makes even the grumblers of the March
achievements flinch.</p>
<p class="quoteb">
"With stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain," [102]</p>
<p>
exclaims the perplexed National Assembly.</p>
<p>These Wrangels and Brandenburgs, these blockheads who can want
because they have no will of their own, because they only want what they
are ordered, and who are too stupid to question the orders they are given
with a faltering voice and trembling lips -- they, too, have discredited
themselves because they did not get down to skull-breaking, the only job
these battering-rams are good for.</p>
<p>Wrangel does not go beyond confessing that he recognizes only
a National Assembly that obeys orders. Brandenburg is given a lesson in
parliamentary behavior, and after having shocked the Chamber with his crude,
repulsive jargon appropriate to a drill-sergeant, he allows the National
Assembly "to tyrannize the tyrant" and carries out its orders by humbly
begging for permission to speak, though he had just attempted to usurp
this right.</p>
<p class="quoteb">
I had rather be a tick in a sheep
<br>Than such a valiant ignorance. [103]</p>
<p>
Berlin's calm attitude delights us; the ideals of the Prussian drill-sergeants
prove unavailing against it.</p>
<p>But the National Assembly? Why does it not use its power to proscribe?
Why does it not outlaw the Wrangels? Why does not one of the deputies step
into the midst of Wrangel's bayonets to outlaw him and address the soldiers?</p>
<p>Let the Berlin National Assembly turn over the leaves of the Moniteur,
[104] the Moniteur for 1789-95.</p>
<p>And what should we do at the present time?</p>
<p>We should refuse to pay taxes. A Wrangel and a Brandenburg understand
-- for these creatures learn Arabic from the Hyghlans [105] -- that they
wear a sword and get a uniform and a salary. But where the sword, the uniform
and the salary come from-that they do not understand.</p>
<p>There is only one means for securing the defeat of the monarchy,
and that is to do it before the advent of the anti-June revolution, which
will take place in Paris in December. [106]</p>
<p>The monarchy defies not only the people, but the bourgeoisie as
well.</p>
<p>Defeat it therefore in a bourgeois manner.</p>
<p>How can one defeat the monarchy in a bourgeois manner?</p>
<p>By starving it into surrender.</p>
<p>And how can one starve it into surrender?</p>
<p>By refusing to pay taxes.</p>
<p>Consider it well. No princes of Prussia, no Brandenburgs and Wrangels
produce the bread for the army. It is you who produce even the bread for
the army.</p>

<h4>Neue Rheinische Zeitung No. 142, November 14, 1848</h4>
<p class="fst"><em>Cologne</em>, November 13. Just as once the French National Assembly, on finding its official meeting place closed, had to continue its session in the tennis-court, so now the Prussian National Assembly has to  meet in the <em>shooting-gallery</em>.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#30" target=_blank>[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>A decision adopted in the shooting-gallery declares <em>Brandenburg a traitor</em>. The text, as received from our Berlin correspondent (who signs his articles <font face="SYMBOL">Q</font> ), is contained in our special edition issued this morning, but it is not mentioned in the report published in the <em>Kölnische Zeitung.</em> <span class="context">[Nov 12 1848]</span></p>
<p>However, we have just received a letter from a <b>member of the National Assembly</b> which we quote <em>word for word</em>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“<b>The National Assembly has unanimously (242 members) declared that by introducing this measure (dissolution of the civic militia) Brandenburg has committed high treason, and any person who actively or passively co-operates in the implementation of this measure is to he regarded as a traitor</b>.” <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#31" target=_blank>[31]</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Dumont’s</em> trustworthiness is well known.</p>
<p>Since the National Assembly has declared <em>Brandenburg a traitor</em>, the <b>obligation to pay taxes</b> ceases <b>automatically</b>. <em>No taxes are to be paid to a government guilty of high treason. </em>Tomorrow we shall inform our readers in greater detail <b>how in England, the oldest constitutional country</b>, a <b>refusal to pay taxes</b> operated during a similar conflict.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#32" target=_blank>[32]</a></sup> Incidentally, the <em>traitorous Government itself </em>has shown the people the right way <b>when it immediately refused to pay taxes</b> (allowances etc.) <b>to the National Assembly</b> in order to <b>starve it out</b>.</p>
<p>The aforementioned deputy writes further:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“<b>The civic militia will not hand over its arms</b>.”</p>
<p><em>A fight therefore seems </em>inevitable, and it is the <em>duty of the Rhine</em><b> </b><em>Province to hasten to the assistance of the Berlin National</em><b> </b><em>Assembly with men and weapons.</em></p>
