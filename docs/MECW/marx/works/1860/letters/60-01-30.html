<h4>London, 30 January 1860</h4>
<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>I was very glad to get your letter. For I had believed — and had written to tell Engels so — that your reason for not writing was pique at my last letter.</p>
<p>I can only spare a minute or two since I have a leader to write today for the <em>New-York Tribune</em>. Quite briefly then:</p>
<p>1. I shall send you the pamphlet on the ‘Communist Trial’ straight away. So far as I am aware, you have already had one from me.</p>
<p>2. Vogt has been careful not to let his <em>Telleringian </em>concoction — i.e. the first version — reach us here. Neither Freiligrath (whom I have just seen) nor Kinkel, nor the <em>Hermann, </em>nor <em>any of the booksellers over here </em>have had it. The imperial rascal wishes, <strong>of course</strong>, to steal a march on me.</p>
<p>What I know, I have learned from the <em>National-Zeitung. </em>A pack of <em>Stieberian </em>lies. I have written and told my <em>lawyer in Berlin </em>to sue the N-Z. for <em>libel. </em>What do you think of this? Let me know <em>by return.</em></p>
<p>From your letter I see that Vogt himself admits having been bought <em>indirectly </em>by Bonaparte, for I <em>know </em>about the <em>manoeuvres </em>of your revolutionary Hungarians. I denounced them in London in an <em>English </em>paper and had five <strong>copies</strong> sent to Mr Kossuth. He kept his trap shut. In New York, and elsewhere, <em>Hungarian refugees </em>have adopted resolutions <em>censuring him.</em></p>
<p>Your reasoning <em>ad vocem </em>Vogt eludes me. I shall <em>write a pamphlet </em>as soon as I get hold of his rubbish. But I shall begin by saying in the foreword that I <em>don’t give a damn </em>about the opinion of <em>your German public.</em></p>
<p><em>Liebknecht</em> is an upright man. The Augsburg <em>Allgemeine Zeitung </em>is — to <em>my </em>mind — just as good as the <em>N-Z. </em>and the <em>Volks-Zeitung.</em></p>
<p>To judge by the excerpts I have seen in the <em>N-Zeitung, </em>Vogt is some kind of Chenu or de la Hodde.</p>
<p>3. About my work on political economy — the second instalment, when it appears, will contain only the conclusion of section 1, Book 1, and there are six books. Hence you cannot wait <em>until it is finished </em>. However, you would, in <em>your own interests, </em>be well-advised to await the next instalment which contains the <em>quintessence. </em>Appalling circumstances are to blame for the fact that it isn’t yet in Berlin.</p>
<p class="sig">Salut.<br>
K. M.</p>
