<p class="fst">I. and II. <em>Status of Savagery </em>and <em>Lower Status of Barbarism, </em>these <em>two ethnical Periods </em>cover at least fourfifths of mankind’s entire existence on Earth.</p>
<p>In the Lower Status, the higher attributes of mankind begin to develop: <em>personal dignity, eloquence, religious sensibility, rectitude, manliness </em>and <em>courage, </em>now <em>common traits of character; </em>but there was also <em>cruelty, treachery </em>and <em>fanaticism</em>. Element worship in religion, with a dim conception of personal gods, and of a <em>Great Spirit, rude verse-making, joint tenement houses, </em>and <em>bread from maize </em>belong to this period. It produced also <em>syndiasmian family </em>and <em>confederacy of tribes, organised into phratries and gentes. </em>The <em>imagination, </em>that great faculty so largely contributing to the elevation of mankind, was <em>now producing an unwritten literature of myths, legends and traditions, </em>already become a powerful stimulus upon the race.</p>

<h3>Greek Tragedy</h3>

<p class="fst"><em>The Turanian system of relations</em> (<em>Asia, Africa, Australia</em>)<em>* </em>corresponding to <em>the Ganovanian </em>in <em>America </em>must have also prevailed among <em>Greek and Latin tribes </em>in the same development period<em>. One characteristic of this</em>: the<em> children of brothers </em>are themselves <em>brothers and sisters</em>, and as such not intermarriable; the <em>children of sisters are similarly </em>related and come<em> under the same prohibition. </em>If Bachofen finds these punaluan marriages <em>lawless, </em>then a man from that period would find <em>most present marriages </em>between <em>near and distant cousins</em>, be it<em> on the father’s side or the mother’s side, incestuous, namely as marriages </em>between <em>consanguineous </em>brothers and sisters. This explains the legend of <em>the Danaides</em> (<em>on which Eschylus bases his Supplices</em>).</p>
<p><em>Danaus and AEgyptus were brothers </em>and descendants of the Argive<em> Io. Danaus </em>had<em> fifty daughters </em>by different wives and <em>AEgyptus fifty sons; </em>the latter sought the first in marriage; these, <em>according to the Turanian system, </em>were<em> brothers and sisters, </em>and so not intermarriable. If there had been <em>descent in male line, </em>they would also have belonged to <em>the same gens, </em>and this would have been another obstacle <em>to marriage. The fifty daughters of Danaus — </em>the Danaides <em>fled from Egypt to Argos </em>to escape unlawful and incestuous wedlock. This event was foretold to Io by Prometheus<em> Aeschylus</em>, 853).</p>
<p>In <em>AEschylus’ </em>play<em> The Supplices </em>the Danaides declare to the <em>kindred Argives</em> (in Argos) that they had not been exiled from Egypt</p>
<p class="indentb">By <em>popular decree</em> on account of a <em>bloody deed</em> (murder) <br>
But [had fled] <em>out of fear of men</em>, <br>
Condemning <em>consanguineous and unholy marriage</em> <br>
<em>To the sons of AEgyptus</em>.</p>
<p>(The passage seems spoiled<em>, grammatically; </em>see Schütz, “<em>AEschylus</em>” (Vol. 2, p. 378)<em>.</em></p>
<p>Further: After they heard the case of the suppliants, the<em> Argives decided in council to grant them protection</em>, which implies the existence of a ban on such marriages and the validity of their objection. At the time this tragedy was performed, in Athens,<em> Athenian law itself facilitated and promoted marriage between children of brothers </em>in the case<em> </em>of <em>heiresses and orphans, </em>although this rule seems to have been confined to such exceptional cases.</p>
