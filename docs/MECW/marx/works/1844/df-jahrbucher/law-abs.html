<p><span class="context">The <em>profane</em> existence of error is discredited after its
heavenly <em>oratio pro aris et focis</em> has been disproved.</span> Man, who looked
for a superhuman being in the fantastic reality of heaven and found nothing
there but the <em>reflection</em> of himself, will no longer be disposed
to find but the <em>semblance</em> of himself, only an inhuman being, where
he seeks and must seek his true reality.
</p>
<p>The basis of irreligious criticism is: <em>Man makes religion,</em>
religion does not make man. Religion is the self-consciousness and self-esteem
of man who has either not yet found himself or has already lost himself
again. But <em>man</em> is no abstract being encamped outside the world.
Man is <em>the world of man</em>, the state, society. This state, this society,
produce religion, an <em>inverted world-consciousness</em>, because they
are an <em>inverted world</em>. Religion is the general theory of that world,
its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in a popular form, its spiritualistic
<em>point d'honneur</em>, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn
complement, its universal source of consolation and justification. It is
the <em>fantastic realisation</em> of the human essence because the <em>human
essence</em> has no true reality. The struggle against religion is therefore
indirectly a fight against <em>the world</em> of which religion is the spiritual
<em>aroma</em>.
</p>
<p><em>Religious</em> distress is at the same time the <em>expression</em>
of real distress and also the <em>protest</em> against real distress. Religion
is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world,
just as it is the spirit of spiritless conditions. It is the <em>opium</em>
of the people.
</p>
<p>To abolish religion as the <em>illusory</em> happiness of the people
is to demand their <em>real</em> happiness. The demand to give up illusions
about the existing state of affairs is the <em>demand to give up a state
of affairs which needs illusions</em>. The criticism of religion is therefore
<em>in embryo the criticism of the vale of tears</em>, the <em>halo</em> of
which is religion.
</p>
<p>Criticism has torn up the imaginary flowers from the chain not
so that man shall wear the unadorned, bleak chain but so that he will shake
off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions
man to make him think and act and shape his reality like a man who has
been disillusioned and has come to reason, so that he will revolve round
himself and therefore round his true sun. Religion is only the illusory
sun which revolves round man as long as he does not revolve round himself.
</p>
<p>The <em>task of history</em>, therefore, once the <em>world beyond
the truth</em> has disappeared, is to establish the <em>truth of this world</em>.
The immediate <em>task of philosophy</em>, which is at the service of history,
once the <em>holy form</em> of human self-estrangement has been unmasked,
is to unmask self-estrangement in its <em>unholy forms</em>. Thus the criticism
of heaven turns into the criticism of the earth, the <em>criticism of religion</em>
into the <em>criticism of law</em> and the <em>criticism of theology</em> into
the <em>criticism of politics</em>.....
</p>
<p>The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism by
weapons, material force must be overthrown by material force; but theory
also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses. Theory
is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates <em>ad hominem</em>,
and it demonstrates <em>ad hominem</em> as soon as it becomes radical. To
be radical is to grasp the root of the matter. But for man the root is
man himself. The evident proof of the radicalism of German theory, and
hence of its practical energy, is that it proceeds from a resolute <em>positive</em>
abolition of religion. The criticism of religion ends with the teaching
that <em>man is the highest being for man</em>, hence with the <em>categorical
imperative to overthrow all relations</em> in which man is a debased, enslaved
forsaken, despicable being.....
</p>
<p><span class="context">The following exposition -- a contribution to that task -- deals
immediately not with the original, but with a copy, the German <em>philosophy</em>
of state and of law, for no other reason than that it deals with <em>Germany</em>.....</span>
