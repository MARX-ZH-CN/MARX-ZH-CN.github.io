<p class="fst"><a name="n1"></a><b>[1]</b> </p>
<p></p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n2"></a><b>[2]</b> Klopstock's <em>Messias.</em> </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n3"></a><b>[3]</b><em>Siegwart: Eine
Klostergeschichte</em> by Miller appeared in 1776 and is typical of the
sentimental trend in literature at the time. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n4"></a><b>[4]</b> Goethe, <em>Faust I. Faust's
Study.</em> Translated by Louis Macneice and E. L. Stahl. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n5"></a><b>[5]</b> <em>Ibid.</em> </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n6"></a><b>[6]</b> A reference to the Confessions of a
beautiful soul which occur in Goethe's novel <em>Wilhelm Meister's
Apprenticeship</em> and which epitomise the cult of sentiment. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n7"></a><b>[7]</b> Wagner was the naive assistant of
Faust. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n8"></a><b>[8]</b> Wolfram von Eschenbach and Gottfried
von Strasbourg were the two chief exponents of the courtly epic in Germany.
Their principal works were <em>Parzival</em> (Wolfram) and <em>Tristan</em>
(Gottfried). </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n9"></a><b>[9]</b> Platen (1796-1835) was a
neo-classical poet who attacked both the Romantics and the Philistines;
essentially second-rate he was himself the object of a notoriously violent
satire by Heine. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n10"></a><b>[10]</b> Chamisso, the well-known author of
<em>Peter Schlemihl</em> also published the <em>Deutscher Musenalmanach</em>
which appeared in Leipzig from 1833 to 1839. Albert Knapp was the editor of
<em>Christoterpe. Ein Taschenbuch für christliche Leser, Heidelberg</em>
1833-53. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n11"></a><b>[11]</b> The supreme Hindu deity Shiva was
also known as Mahadeva. In the form used by Marx, Mahadoh, there is an echo of
Goethe's poem <em>Der Gott und die Bajadere.</em> </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n12"></a><b>[12]</b> The conflict between duty and
inclination is seen by the mature Schiller as central to tragedy. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n13"></a><b>[13]</b> Christian Heinrich Spiess
(1755-99), Heinrich Clauren (177I-1854), and Karl Gottlob Cramer (1758-1817)
were all writers of popular novels or adventure stories. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n14"></a><b>[14]</b> <em>Heinrich von Ofterdingen</em>
by Novalis was a paradigmatic work of the German Romantic school. The hero --
modelled on a mediaeval poet of that name -- spends his life in a search for
the "blue flower" which becomes a symbol of that infinite romantic longing for
the ideal, poetic realm removed from that of reality. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n15"></a><b>[15]</b> The concluding lines of Goethe's
<em>Zahme Xenien</em> in which he makes fum of Pustkuchen's
<em>Wanderjahre</em>, a work parasitic on his own Wilhem Meister and one which
was for a while thought to be from his own pen. Goethe's own Italian Journey
marks a decisive change in his career. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n16"></a><b>[16]</b> Kotzebue was an immensely popular
writer of superficial melodramas. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n17"></a><b>[17]</b> Hegel, <em>The Phenomenology of

Liebe</em> was one of the chief works of the German Storm and Stress period.
</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n19"></a><b>[19]</b> Johann Heinrich Jung-Stilling
(1740-1817) a sentimental, pietistic writer. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n20"></a><b>[20]</b> Bettina von Arnim had managed to
captivate the aging Goethe while she was herself scarcely more than a
precocious child. Her publication of Goethe's <em>Briefwechsel mit einem
Kinde</em> brought her a certain notoriety. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n21"></a><b>[21]</b> The critical movement, i.e. the
Young Hegelians, Strauss, Bruno Bauer and Feuerbach. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n22"></a><b>[22]</b> Tale by Clemens Brentano, one of
the chief exponents of German Romanticism. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n23"></a><b>[23]</b> The Göttinger Hain poets (Holty
and Voss were the most important) were active from 1772 to 1774. Influenced by
Klopstock and Bürger they played an important role in the formation of German
literature before subsiding into philistinism. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n24"></a><b>[24]</b> The reference is to the artisans'
congresses that took place in various towns in Germany in 1848 and which
produced programmes for restoring the guilds to their former prosperity in
accordance with Wmkelblech's utopian theories. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n25"></a><b>[25]</b> The dictated constitution was
introduced by Frederick William IV on December 5, 1848. The Lower Chamber met
on February 26, 1849, but was dissolved by the government on April 27, 1849.
</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n26"></a><b>[26]</b> The battle of Rastatt took place
on June 29 &amp; 30, 1849. The defeat of the democratic forces at the hands of
the Prussian troops marked the end of the Baden campagne. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n27"></a><b>[27]</b> The reference is to Goethe's
celebrated novel, <em>The Sufferings of Young Werther.</em> </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n28"></a><b>[28]</b> May 1852, i.e. the French
presidential election which the democratic movement and especially the
<em>émigré's</em> hoped would inaugurate a new democratic epoch. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n29"></a><b>[29]</b> I.e. the campagne for the Imperial
Constitution whose defeat at Rastatt ended the revolutionary struggles. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n30"></a><b>[30]</b> The Camphausen Ministry in Prussia
lasted from March to June 1848. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n31"></a><b>[31]</b> The Prussian Assembly was
dissolved in November 1848. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n32"></a><b>[32]</b> The <em>Neue Preussische
Zeitung</em> also known as the "Kreuzzeitung" was founded in June 1848. It was
the organ of the extreme right-wing court camarilla. As such it opposed
Manteuffel's more moderate conservatism. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n33"></a><b>[33]</b> The Dresden Uprising lasted from
May 3 to May 8, 1849. It broke out when the King of Saxony refused to recognise
the Imperial Constitution. The insurrection was led by Bakunin and Samuel
Tzschirner and involved workers and artisans. Hence an appeal to the bourgeois
democrats of Leipzig went unheeded. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n34"></a><b>[34]</b> The reference is to June 13, 1849,
when Louis Napoleon defeated a challenge to his power by Ledru-Rollin and the
Montagne. The influence of the Montagne was now broken and Ledru and others
fled into exile. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n35"></a><b>[35]</b> Brüggemann was chief editor of the
<em>Kölnische Zeitung</em>, 1840-1855. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n36"></a><b>[36]</b> Arnold Winkelried was the
half-legendary popular hero of the Swiss war of liberation against the
Habsburgs. According to tradition he opened the attack in the decisive battle
of Sempach (1386) with the cry "Der Freiheit eine Gasse!" </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n37"></a><b>[37]</b> Boiardo, <em>L'Orlando
inamorato</em>, canto 17. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n38"></a><b>[38]</b> I.e. the <em>Karlsruher

<p class="fst"><a name="n39"></a><b>[39]</b> A popular sentimental novel by J.
T. Hermes. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n40"></a><b>[40]</b> The March Clubs were the branches,
existing in various German cities of the Central March Club, that had been
founded in November 1848 by members of the Frankfurt Left. They were frequency
attacked by Marx and Engels in the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> for their
failure to take action. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n41"></a><b>[41]</b> Ludwig Börne was the founder of
modern polemical German literature. Widely read in his day he exercised a
profound influence on the style of Engels and perhaps also Marx. He is now
unjustly neglected. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n42"></a><b>[42]</b> Jakob Venedey, <em>Preussen und
Preussentum.</em> Mannheim 1839. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n43"></a><b>[43]</b> Alcina figures both in the
<em>Orlandofurioso</em> of Ariosto and the <em>Orlando Inamorato</em> of
Boiardo. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n44"></a><b>[44]</b> The “wet” Quakers were
a reformist trend within the movement in the Twenties of the 19th century. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n45"></a><b>[45]</b> See Note 3 to the "Revelations".
</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n46"></a><b>[46]</b> Bronzell was the site of an
unimportant skirmish between Prussian and Austrian troops on November 8, 1850.
It resulted from the claims of both sides to have the sole right to intervene
in the affairs of Hesse and to crush an uprising there. Austria received
diplomatic support from Russia and so Prussia had to yield. The agreement then
reached at Olmütz effectively consolidated the Reaction. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n47"></a><b>[47]</b> I.e. in <em>Die Jobsiade. Ein
komisches Heldengedicht</em> by K. A. Kortum. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n48"></a><b>[48]</b> The Hambacher Fest was a political

abolition of the freedom of the press and association. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n49"></a><b>[49]</b> The invasion of Savoy was
organised by Mazzini and took place in 1834. A detachment of <em>émigrés</em>
of various nationalities marched on Savoy under the leadership of Ramorino, but
was defeated by Piedmontese troops. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n50"></a><b>[50]</b> In June 1844 the Bandiera
brothers, who were members of a secret conspiratorial organisation, landed on
the Calabrian coast with the intention of sparking off an insurrection against
the Neapolitan Bourbons and the Austrian yoke. They were betrayed by one of
their number, taken prisoner and shot. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n51"></a><b>[51]</b> The Dukes of Augustenburg were a
branch of the Holstein Ducal House. Their denial of the claims of the Danish
kings to Schleswig-Holstem was a factor in German Danish relations and the
complicated Schleswig-Holstein Question. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n52"></a><b>[52]</b> At the Warsaw Conference in
October 1850 which was attended by Russia, Austria and Prussia the attempt was
made to force Prussia to abandon all plans to unite Germany under its own
hegemony. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n53"></a><b>[53]</b> The anniversary of the abdication
of Louis Philippe on February 24, 1848. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n54"></a><b>[54]</b> The Vorpariament met in Frankfurt
from March 31 and April 4, 1848, pending the election of an all-German Assembly
and the formulation of a definitive constitution. It was moderate, i.e.
constitutionalist and monarchist in character. </p>

<p class="fst"><a name="n58"></a><b>[58]</b> Goethe, <em>Anmerkungen über
Personen und Gegenstande, deren im dem Dialog “Rameau's Neffe”
erwähnt wird</em> </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n59"></a><b>[59]</b> Jean-Victor Moreau, a general in
the French Revolutionary army; as commander of the Rhine Moselle Army he gained
fame with a brilliantly conducted retreat in face of superior enemy forces in
1797. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n60"></a><b>[60]</b> Black, red and yellow or gold were

book <em>Theorie des Grossen Krieges angewendet auf den russisch-polnischen
