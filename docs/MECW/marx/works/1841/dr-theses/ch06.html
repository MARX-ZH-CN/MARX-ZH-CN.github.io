Chapter Three: <em>Atomoi archai</em> [indivisible principles] and <em>atoma stoicheia</em> [indivisible elements]
</h3>

<p class="skip"> </p>
<p class="fst">
<em>Schaubach</em>, in his treatise on the astronomical concepts of Epicurus, to which we have already referred, makes the following assertion:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Epicurus, as well as <em>Aristotle, </em>has made a distinction between principles [<em>Anfänge</em>] (<em>atomoi archai</em>, Diogenes Laertius, X, 41) and <em>elements</em> (<em>atoma stoicheia</em>, Diogenes Laertius, X, 86).  The former are the atoms recognisable only through reason and do not occupy space.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" name="1b">(1)</a></sup> These are called atoms not because they are the smallest bodies, but because they are indivisible in space.  According to these conceptions one might think that Epicurus did not attribute any spatial properties to the atom.<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" name="2b">(2)</a></sup> But in the letter to Herodotus (Diogenes Laertius, X, 44, 54) he gives the atoms not only weight but also size and shape.... I therefore consider these atoms as belonging to the second species, those that have developed out of the former but can still be regarded again as elementary particles of the bodies.<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" name="3b">(3)</a></sup></p>
<p class="fst">
Let us look more closely at the passage which <em>Schaubach</em> cites from Diogenes Laertius.  It reads: <em>For instance such propositions that the All consists of bodies and non-corporeal nature, or that there are indivisible elements and other such statements.</em></p>
<p>
Epicurus here teaches Pythocles, to whom he is writing, that the teaching about meteors differs from all other doctrines in physics, for example, that everything is either body or void, that there are indivisible basic elements.  It is obvious that there is here no reason to assume that it is a question of a second species of atoms. <sup class="anote"><a href="#4" name="4b">(4)</a></sup><!--We can equally conclude (justly or unjustly) from the passage 'for this there is no beginning, the atoms being the cause', that Epicurus has assumed a third kind, the <em>atoma aitia</em> 'atoms as cause'--> It may perhaps seem that the disjunction between ‘The All consisting of bodies and non-corporeal bodies’ and ‘that there are indivisible elements establishes a difference between <em>soma</em> and <em>aroma</em> <em>stoicheia</em>, so that we might say that <em>soma</em> stands for atoms of the first kind in contrast to the <em>atoma stoicheia</em>.  But this is quite out of the question.  <em>Soma</em> means the corporeal in contrast to the void, which for this reason is called <em>asomaton</em>’. <sup class="anote"><a href="#5" name="5b">(5)</a></sup> The term <em>soma</em> therefore includes the atoms as well as compound bodies. For example, in the letter to Herodotus we read: ‘The All is body ... if there were not that which we call void, space and non-corporeal nature.... Among bodies some are compound, others the things out of which the compounds are made, and <em>these </em>latter are indivisible and unchangeable.... Consequently these first principles are necessarily of indivisible corporeal nature’ <sup class="anote"><a href="#6" name="6b">(6)</a></sup></p>
<p>
Epicurus is thus speaking in the passage cited first of the corporeal in general, in contrast to the void, and then of the corporeal in particular, the atoms. <!--<em>Atoma stoicheia</em> here has no other meaning than <em>atomoi physeis</em>, of which it is said in the last quoted passage that they are <em>archai</em>--></p>
<p>
<em>Schaubach’s</em> reference to Aristotle proves just as little.  True the difference between <em>arche</em> and <em>stoicheion</em>, which the Stoics particularly insist upon,<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" name="7b">(7)</a></sup> can indeed also be found in Aristotle,<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" name="8b">(8)</a></sup> but he nonetheless assumes the identity of the two expressions.<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" name="9b">(9)</a></sup> He even teaches explicitly that <em>stoicheion</em> denotes primarily the atom.<sup class="anote"><a href="#10" name="10b">(10)</a></sup> Leucippus and Democritus likewise call the <em>Fullness and void.</em> <sup class="anote"><a href="#11" name="11b">(11)</a></sup></p>
<p>
In Lucretius, in Epicurus’ letters as quoted by Diogenes Laertius, in the <em>Colotes </em>of Plutarch,<sup class="anote"><a href="#12" name="12b">(12)</a></sup> in Sextus Empiricus,<sup class="anote"><a href="#13" name="13b">(13)</a></sup> the properties are ascribed to the atoms themselves, and for this reason they were determined as transcending themselves [<em>sich selbst</em> <em>aufhebend</em>].</p>
<p>
However, if it is thought an antinomy that bodies perceptible only to reason should be endowed with spatial qualities, then it is an even greater antinomy that the spatial qualities themselves can be perceived only through the intellect.<sup class="anote"><a href="#14" name="14b">(14)</a></sup></p>
<p>
Finally, <em>Schaubach</em>, in further support of his view, cites the following passage from Stobaeus: ‘Epicurus [states] that the primary (bodies) should be simple, those bodies compounded from them however should have weight’</p>
<p>
To this passage from Stobaeus could be added the following, in which <em>atoma stoicheia </em>are mentioned as a particular kind of atom: (Plutarch.) <em>De placit. philosoph., </em>I, 246 and 249, and Stob., <em>Physical Selections</em>, I, p. 5.<sup class="anote"><a href="#15" name="15b">(15)</a></sup> For the rest it is by no means claimed in these passages that the original atoms are without size, shape and weight.  On the contrary, weight alone is mentioned as a distinctive characteristic of the <em>atomoi archai </em>and aroma <em>stoicheia </em>. But we observed already in the preceding chapter that weight is applied only in regard to repulsion and the conglomerations arising therefrom.</p>
<p>
With the invention of the <em>atoma stoicheia </em>we also gain nothing.  It is just as difficult to pass from the <em>atomoi archai</em> to the aroma <em>stoicheia</em> as it is to ascribe properties directly to them.  Nevertheless I do not deny such a differentiation entirely.  I only deny that there are two different and fixed kinds of atoms.  They are rather different determinations of one and the same kind.</p>
<p>
Before discussing this difference I would like to call attention to a procedure typical of Epicurus.  He likes to assume the different determinations of a concept as different independent existences. just as his principle is the atom, so is the manner of his cognition itself atomistic.  Every moment of the development is at once.. transformed in his hands into a fixed reality which, so to say, is separated from its relations to other things by empty space; every determination assumes the form of isolated individuality.</p>
<p>
This procedure may be made clear by the following example.</p>
<p>
The infinite, <em>to apeiron</em>, or the <em>infinitio</em>, as Cicero translates it, is occasionally used by Epicurus as a particular nature; and precisely in the same passages in which we find the <em>stoicheia</em> described as a fixed fundamental substance, we also find the <em>apeiron</em> turned into something independent.<sup class="anote"><a href="#16" name="16b">(16)</a></sup></p>
<p>
However, according to Epicurus’ own definitions, the infinite is neither a particular substance nor something outside of the atoms and the void, but rather an accidental determination of the void.  We find in fact three meanings of <em>apeiron</em>.</p>
<p>
First, <em>apeiron</em> expresses for Epicurus a quality common to the atoms and the void.  It means in this sense the infinitude of the All, which is infinite by virtue of the infinite multiplicity of the atoms, by virtue of the infinite size of the void.<sup class="anote"><a href="#17" name="17b">(17)</a></sup></p>
<p>
Secondly, <em>apeiria</em> is the multiplicity of the atoms, so that not the atom, but the infinitely many atoms are placed in opposition to the void.<sup class="anote"><a href="#18" name="18b">(18)</a></sup></p>
<p>
Finally, if we may draw from Democritus a conclusion about Epicurus, <em>apeiron</em> also means exactly the opposite, the unlimited void, which is placed in opposition to the atom determined in itself and limited by itself.<sup class="anote"><a href="#19" name="19b">(19)</a></sup></p>
<p>
In all these meanings -and they are the only ones, even the only possible ones for atomistics-the infinite is a mere determination of the atoms and of the void.  Nevertheless, it is singled out as a particular existence, even set up as a specific nature alongside the principles whose determination it expresses. <!--This example is convincing.--></p>
<p>
Therefore, even if Epicurus himself thus fixed the determination by which the atom becomes <em>stoicheion</em> as an independent original kind of atom-which, by the way, is not the case judging by the historical superiority of one source over the other, even if Metrodorus <sup class="ednote"><a href="../../cw/volume01/footnote.htm#26" name="a26">[26]</a></sup> the disciple of Epicurus-as it seems more probable to us — was the first to change the differentiated determination into a differentiated existence<sup class="anote"><a href="#20" name="20b">(20)</a></sup>; we must ascribe to the subjective mode of atomistic consciousness the changing of separate moments into something independently existing.  The granting of the form of existence to different determinations has not resulted in understanding of their difference.</p>
<p>
For Democritus the atom means only <em>stoicheion </em>a material substrate.  The distinction between the atom as arche and <em>stoicheion</em> as principle and foundation belongs to Epicurus.  Its importance will be clear from what follows.</p>
<p>
The contradiction between existence and essence, between matter and form, which is inherent in the concept of the atom, emerges in the individual atom itself once it is endowed with qualities.  Through the quality the atom is alienated from its concept, but at the same time is perfected in its construction.  It is from repulsion and the ensuing conglomerations of the qualified .atoms that the world of appearance now emerges.</p>
<p>
In this transition from the world of essence to the world of appearance, the contradiction in the concept of the atom clearly reaches its harshest realisation.  For the atom is conceptually the absolute, essential form of nature. <em>This absolute </em>form has now <em>been degraded to absolute matter, to the formless substrate of the world of</em> <em>appearance.</em></p>
<p>
The atoms are, it is true, the substance of nature,<sup class="anote"><a href="#21" name="21b">(21)</a></sup> out of which everything emerges, into which everything dissolves<sup class="anote"><a href="#22" name="22b">(22)</a></sup>; but the continuous annihilation of the world of appearance comes to no result.  New appearances are formed; but the atom itself always remains at the bottom as the foundations<sup class="anote"><a href="#23" name="23b">(23)</a></sup> Thus insofar as the atom is considered as pure concept, its existence is empty space, annihilated nature.  Insofar as it proceeds to reality, it sinks down to the material basis which, as the bearer of a world of manifold relations, never exists but in forms which are indifferent and external to it.  This is a necessary consequence, since the atom, presupposed as abstractly individual and complete, cannot actualise itself as the idealising and pervading power of this manifold.</p>
<p>
Abstract individuality is freedom from being, not freedom in being.  It cannot shine in the light of being.  This is an element in which this individuality loses its character and becomes material.  For this reason the atom does not enter into the daylight of appearances<sup class="anote"><a href="#24" name="24b">(24)</a></sup> or it sinks down to the material basis when it does enter it.  The atom as such only exists in the void.  The death of nature has thus become its immortal substance; and Lucretius correctly exclaims:</p>
<p class="quoteb">When death immortal claims his mortal life (<em>De verum nature</em> III, 869).</p>
<p class="fst">
But the fact that Epicurus grasps the contradiction at this its highest peak and objectives it, and therefore distinguishes the atom where it becomes the basis of appearance as <em>stoicheion</em> from the atom as it exists in the void as <em>arche</em> — this constitutes his philosophical difference from Democritus, who only objectives the one moment.  This is the same distinction which in the world of essence, in the realm of the atoms and of the void, separates Epicurus from Democritus.  However, since only the atom with qualities is the complete one, since the world of appearance can only emerge from the atom which is complete and alienated from its concept, Epicurus expresses this by stating that only the qualified atom becomes <em>stoicheion</em> or only the <em>atomon stoicheion </em>is endowed with qualities.</p>
