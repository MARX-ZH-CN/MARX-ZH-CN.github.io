<h3>[1.  The Discovery of the Law of Differential Rent by
Anderson.  Distortion of Anderson’s Views by His Plagiarist,
Malthus, in the Interests of the Landowners]</h3>
<p><a name="vol31-p344"> </a></p>
<p><em>Anderson</em> was a practical farmer.  His first work, in
which the nature of rent is discussed <em>in passing</em>, appeared in
1777, at a time when, for a large section of the public, Sir James
Steuart was still the leading economist, and while everyone’s
attention was focused on the <em>Wealth of Nations</em>, which had
appeared a year earlier.  As against this, the work of the
Scottish farmer, which had been occasioned by an immediate practical
controversy and which did not <em>ex professo</em> deal with rent but
only incidentally elucidated its nature, could not attract any
attention.  In this work, Anderson only dealt with rent
accidentally, not <em>ex professo</em>.  This theory of his appears
again, in the same incidental fashion, in one or two of his collected
essays which he himself published in three volumes under the title of:
<em>Essays Relating to Agriculture and Rural Affairs</em>, 3 vols.,
Edinburgh, 1775-1796.  Similarly in his
<em>Recreations in Agriculture, Natural History, Arts</em>, etc., London
(to be looked up in the British Museum) which were published in the
years 1799 to 1802, all these writings are directly intended for
farmers and agriculturists.  [It would have been] different if
Anderson had had an inkling of the importance of his find and had put
it before the public separately, as an “Inquiry into the Nature
of Rent”, or if he had had the least bit of talent in trading
his own ideas, as his fellow countryman, McCulloch, did so
successfully with other people’s.  The reproductions of his
theory which appeared in 1815 were published forthwith as independent
<em>theoretical</em> inquiries into the nature of rent, as the very
titles of the respective works of West and Malthus show:</p>
<p>Malthus: <em>An Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of
Rent</em>.</p>
<p>West: <em>Essay on the Application of Capital to Land</em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Malthus used the Andersonian theory of rent to give
his population law, for the first time, both an economic and a real
(natural-historical) basis, while the nonsense about geometrical and
arithmetical progression borrowed from earlier writers, was a purely
imaginary hypothesis.  Mr. Malthus at once “improved”
the matter, <em>Ricardo</em> even made this doctrine of rent, as he
himself says in his preface, one of the most important links in the
whole system of political economy and—quite apart from the
practical aspect—gave it an entirely new theoretical
importance.</p>
<p>Ricardo evidently did not know Anderson since, in the preface to
his <em>Principles of Political Economy</em>, he treats West and Malthus
as the originators.  Judging by the original manner in which he
presents the law, <em>West</em> was possibly as little acquainted with
Anderson as Tooke was with Steuart.  With Mr. Malthus it is
different.  A close comparison of his writings shows that he
knows and uses Anderson.  He was in fact <em>plagiarist</em> by
<span class="context">||496|</span> profession.  One need only
compare <em>the first edition</em> of his work on population with the
work of the Reverend Townsend which I have quoted previously, to he
convinced that he does not work him over as an independent producer,
but copies him and paraphrases him like a slavish plagiarist, although
he does <em>not mention him anywhere by name</em> and
<em>conceals</em> his existence.</p>
<p>The manner in which Malthus used Anderson is characteristic. 
Anderson had defended premiums on exports of corn and duties on corn
imports, not out of any interest for the landlords, but because he
believed that this type of legislation “would
<em>reduce</em> the average price of corn” and ensure an even
development of the productive forces in agriculture.  Malthus
accepted this practical application of Anderson’s because—being
a staunch member of the Established Church of England—he was a
professional sycophant of the landed aristocracy, whose rents,
sinecures, squandering, heartlessness etc.  he justified
<em>economically</em>.  Malthus defends the interests of the
industrial bourgeoisie only in so far as these are identical with the
interests of landed property, of the aristocracy, i.e., <em>against</em>
the mass of the people, the proletariat.  But where these
interests diverge and are antagonistic to each other, he sides with
the aristocracy against the bourgeoisie.  Hence his defence of
the “<em>unproductive</em> worker”, over-consumption
etc.</p>
<p>Anderson, on the other hand, explained the difference between land
which pays rent and that which does not, or between lands which pay
varying rents, by the <em>relatively</em> low fertility of the land
which hears <em>no</em> rent or a <em>smaller</em> rent compared with that
which bears a rent or a greater rent.  But he stated expressly
that these degrees of relative productivity of <em>different</em> types
of land, i.e., also the relatively low productivity of the worse types
of land compared with the better, had absolutely nothing to do with
the
<em>absolute</em> productivity of agriculture. 
<em>On the contrary</em>, he stressed not only that the absolute
productivity <sub class="ratio">0</sub>f all types of land could he constantly
improved and must be improved with the progress in population, but he
went further and asserted that the
<em>differences</em> in <em>productivity</em> of various types of land can
be progressively <em>reduced</em>.  He said that the present degree
of development of agriculture in England gives no indication at all of
its <em>possibilities</em>.  That is why he said that in one
country the prices of corn may be high and rent Low, while in another
country the price of corn may be low and rent may he high, and this is
in accordance with his principle, since the level and the existence of
rents is in both countries determined by the <em>difference</em> between
the fertile and the unfertile land, in neither of them by the absolute
fertility; in each only by the degree of difference in fertility of
the existing types of land, and not by the average fertility of these
types of land, From this he concluded that the absolute fertility of
agriculture has nothing to do with rent.  Hence later, as we
shall see below, he declared himself a decided adversary of the
Malthusian theory of population and it never dawned on him that his
own theory of rent was to serve as the basis of this
monstrosity.  Anderson reasoned that the rise in corn prices in
England between 1750 and 1801 as compared with the years 1700 to 1750
was by no means due to the cultivation of progressively less fertile
types of land, but to the influence of legislation on agriculture
during these two periods.</p>
<p>What then did Malthus do?</p>
<p>Instead of his (also plagiarised) chimera of the geometrical and
arithmetical progression, which he retained as a “phrase”,
he made Anderson’s theory the confirmation of his population
theory.  He retained Anderson’s practical application of the
theory in so far as it was in the interests of the
landlords—this fact alone proves that he understood as little of
the connection of this theory with the system of bourgeois economy as
Anderson himself.  Without going into the counter-evidence which
the discoverer of the theory put forward, he turned it against the
proletariat.  The theoretical and practical advance which could
have been made from this theory was: theoretical—for the
determination of the <em>value</em> of the commodity etc. and gaining an
insight into the nature of landownership; practical—against the
necessity of private ownership of the land, on the <em>basis of
bourgeois production</em> and, more immediately, against all state
regulations such as corn laws, which enhanced this ownership of
land.  These advances from Anderson’s theory, Malthus left to
Ricardo.  The one practical conclusion which he drew from it was
a defence of the protective tariffs which the landlords demanded in
<em>1815</em>— a sycophantic service for the aristocracy and a new
<em>justification</em> for the poverty of the producers of wealth, a new
apology for the exploiters of labour.  In this respect it was a
sycophantic service for the industrial capitalists.</p>
<p><em>Utter baseness</em> is a distinctive trait of Malthus—a
baseness which can only he indulged in by a parson <span class="context">||497|</span> who sees human suffering as the
punishment for sin and who, in any ease, needs a “vale of tears
on earth”, but who, at the same time, in view of the living he
draws and aided by the dogma of predestination, finds it altogether
advantageous to “sweeten” their sojourn in the vale of
tears for the ruling classes.  The “baseness” of this
mind is also evident in his scientific work. 
<em>Firstly</em> in his shameless and mechanical
<em>plagiarism.  Secondly</em> in the <em>cautious</em>, not
<em>radical</em>, conclusions which he draws from scientific
premises.</p>
<p><a name="s2"> </a></p>
<h3>[2.  Ricardo’s Fundamental Principle in Assessing Economic
Phenomena Is the Development of the Productive Forces.  Malthus
Defends the Most Reactionary Elements of the Ruling Classes. 
Virtual Refutation of Malthus’s Theory of Population by Darwin]</h3>
<p>Ricardo, rightly for his time, regards the capitalist mode of
production as the most advantageous for production in general, as the
most advantageous for the creation of wealth.  He wants
<em>production for the sake of production</em> and this with <em>good
reason</em>.  To assert, as sentimental opponents of Ricardo’s
did, that production as such is not the object, is to forget that
production for its own sake means nothing but the development of human
productive forces, in other words the <em>development of the richness
of human nature as an end in itself</em>.  To oppose the welfare
of the individual to this end, as Sismondi does, is to assert that the
development of the species must be <em>arrested</em> in order to
safeguard the welfare of the individual, so that, for instance,
no war may be waged in which at all events some individuals
perish.  Sismondi is only right as against the economists who
<em>conceal</em> or deny this contradiction.)  Apart from the
barrenness of such edifying reflections, they reveal a failure to
understand the fact that, although at first the development of the
capacities of the <em>human</em> species takes place at the cost of the
majority of human individuals and even classes, in the end it breaks
through this contradiction and coincides with the development of the
individual; the higher development of individuality is thus only
achieved by a historical process during which individuals are
sacrificed for the interests of the species in the human kingdom, as
in the animal and plant kingdoms, always assert themselves at the cost
of the interests of individuals, because these interests of the
species coincide only with the <em>interests of certain
individuals</em>, and it is this coincidence which constitutes the
strength of these privileged individuals.</p>
<p>Thus Ricardo’s ruthlessness was not only <em>scientifically
honest</em> but also a scientific <em>necessity</em> from his point of
view.  But because of this it is also quite immaterial to him
whether the advance of the productive forces slays landed property or
workers.  If this progress devalues the capital of the industrial
bourgeoisie it is equally welcome to him.  If the development of
the productive power of labour halves the value of the <em>existing</em>
fixed capital, what does it matter, says Ricardo.  The
productivity of human labour has doubled, Thus here is <em>scientific
honesty</em>.  Ricardo’s conception is, on the whole, in the
interests of the <em>industrial</em> bourgeoisie, only because, and
<em>in so far as</em> their interests coincide with that of production
or the productive development of human labour.  Where the
bourgeoisie comes into conflict with this, he is just as
<em>ruthless</em> towards it as he is at other times towards the
proletariat and the aristocracy.</p>
<p>But <em>Malthus!</em> This wretch only draws such conclusions from
the given scientific premises (which he invariably <em>steals</em>), as
will be ‘<em>agreeable</em>” (useful) to the aristocracy
against the bourgeoisie and to both <em>against</em> the
proletariat.  Hence he does not want <em>production</em> for <em>the
sake of production</em>, but only in so far as it maintains or extends
the
<em>status quo</em>, and serves the interests of the ruling classes.</p>
<p>Already his first work, one of the most remarkable literary
examples of the success of plagiarism at the cost of the original
work, had the practical purpose to provide “economic”
proof, in the interests of the existing English government and the
landed <em>aristocracy</em> that the tendency of the French Revolution
and <em>its adherents in England</em> to perfect matters was
utopian.  In other words, it was a panegyric pamphlet for the
<em>existing</em> conditions, against historical development and,
furthermore, a justification of the war against revolutionary
France.</p>
<p>His writings of 1815, on protective tariffs and rent, were partly
means to confirm the earlier apology of the poverty of the producers,
in particular, however, to defend reactionary landed property against
‘enlightened’ “literal” and
“progressive” capital and especially to justify an
intended <em>retrogressive</em> step in English legislation in the
interests of the aristocracy against the industrial bourgeoisie. 
Finally, <span class="context">||498|</span> his Principles of
<em>Political</em> Economy directed <em>against</em> Ricardo had
essentially the purpose of reducing the absolute demands of
‘industrial capital” and the laws under which its
productivity develops, to the ‘desirable limits”
“favourable” to the existing interests of the landed
aristocracy, the “Established Church” (to which Mal-thus
belonged), government pensioners and consumers of taxes.  But
when a man seeks to <em>accommodate</em> science to a viewpoint which is
derived not from science itself (however erroneous it may be) but from
<em>outside, from alien, external interests</em>, then 1 call him
“base”.</p>
<p>It is not a base action when Ricardo puts the proletariat on the
same level as machinery or beasts of burden or commodities because
(from his point of view) their being purely machinery or beasts of
burden is conducive to “production” or because they really
are mere commodities in bourgeois production.  This is
stoic, objective, scientific.  In so far as it does not involve
<em>sinning</em> against his science, Ricardo is always a
philanthropist, just as he was in <em>practice</em> too.</p>
<p>The parson Malthus on the other hand, reduces the worker to a beast
of burden for the sake of production and even condemns bin to death
from starvation and to celibacy.  But when these same demands of
production curtail the landlord’s “rent” or threaten to
encroach on the ‘tithes” of the Established Church, or on
the interests of the “consumers of taxes”; and also when
that part of the industrial bourgeoisie whose interests stand in the
way of progress is being sacrificed to that part which represents the
advance of production—and therefore whenever it is a question of
the interests of the aristocracy against the bourgeoisie or of the
conservative and stagnant bourgeoisie against the progressive—in
all these instances “parson” Malthus does not sacrifice
the particular interests to production but <em>seeks</em>, as far as he
can, to sacrifice the demands of production to the particular
interests of existing ruling classes or sections of classes.  And
to this end he <em>falsifies</em> his scientific conclusions.  This
is his
<em>scientific</em> baseness, his sin against science, quite apart from
his shameless and mechanical plagiarism.  The scientific
conclusions of Malthus are ‘<em>considerate</em>” towards
the ruling classes in general and towards the reactionary elements of
the ruling classes in particular; in other words he <em>falsifies</em>
science for these interests, But his conclusions are <em>ruthless</em>
as far as they concern the subjugated classes.  He is not only
<em>ruthless;</em> he
<em>affects</em> ruthlessness; he takes a cynical pleasure in it and
<em>exaggerates</em> his conclusions in so far as they are directed
against the poor wretches, even <em>beyond</em> the point which would be
scientifically justified from his point of view.<a href="#-ftn1" name="_ftnref1">*</a></p>
<p>The hatred of the English working classes for Malthus—the
“<em>mountebank-parson</em>” as Cobbett <em>rudely</em> called
him (Cobbett, though England’s greatest <em>political</em> writer of
this century, lacked the Leipzig professorial scholarship and was a
pronounced enemy of the “learned language”)—was thus
fully justified and the people’s instinct was correct here, in that
they felt he was no <em>man of science</em>, but a bought advocate of
their opponents, a shameless sycophant of the ruling classes.</p>
<p>The inventor of an idea may exaggerate it in all honesty; when the
plagiarist exaggerates it, he always makes “a business” of
such an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Because the first edition of Malthus’s work <em>On Population</em>
contains not a single <em>new</em> scientific
<em>word</em>, it is to be regarded purely as an obtrusive Capuchin’s
sermon, an Abraham a Santa Clara version of the discoveries of
Townsend, Steuart, Wallace, Herbert etc.  Since in fact it only
wants to impress by its <em>popular</em> form, <em>popular</em> hate
rightly turns against it.</p>
<p>As compared to the wretched bourgeois economists who preach
harmony, Malthus’s only merit lies in his pointed emphasis on the
disharmonies, which, though none of them were <em>discovered</em> by him
were all emphasised, amplified and publicised by him with complacent
sacerdotal cynicism.</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||499|</span> <em>Charles Darwin</em>, in the
introduction to his <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural
Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for
Life</em> (5th thousand), London, 1860, says the following:</p>
<p class="quote">“In the next chapter the <em>Struggle for
Existence</em> amongst all organic beings throughout the world, which
inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of their increase,
will he treated of.  This is the doctrine of <em>Malthus</em>
applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms”
(pp. 4-5).</p>
<p>In his splendid work, <em>Darwin</em> did not realise that by
discovering the “geometrical” progression in the animal
and plant kingdom, he <em>overthrew</em> Malthus’s theory. 
Malthus’s theory is based on the fact that he set Wallace’s
geometrical progression of man against the chimerical
“<em>arithmetical</em>” progression of animals and
plants.  In Darwin’s work, for instance on the extinction of
species, we also find quite apart from his fundamental principle) the
detailed refutation, based on natural history, of the Malthusian
theory.  But in so far as Malthus’s theory rests upon Anderson’s
theory of rent, it was refuted by <em>Anderson himself</em>. 
<span class="context">|499||</span></p>
<p><a name="s3"> </a></p>
<h3>[3.  Roscher’s Falsification of the History of Views on
Ground-Rent.  Examples of Ricardo’s Scientific
Impartiality.  Rent from Capital Investment in Land and Rent from
the Exploitation of Other Elements of Nature.  The Twofold
Influence of Competition]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||499|</span> Anderson’s first publication,
in which he develops the theory of rent as a by-product, was a
<em>practical</em> polemic, not on rent but on protection.  It
appeared in 1777 and its very title, An
<em>Enquiry into the Nature of the Corn Laws, with a View to the New
Corn Bill Proposed for Scotland</em>, Edinburgh, 1777, shows firstly,
that it pursues a practical purpose, secondly, that it is related to
an imminent act of legislation, in which the interests of the
manufacturers and the landlords are diametrically opposed.</p>
<p>The law of 1773 (in England; to be looked up in McCulloch’s
<em>Catalogue</em>), was due (so it appears) to be introduced into
Scotland in 1777 (see in the Museum).</p>
<p class="quote">“The law of 1773 was constructed,” says
Anderson, wilt the “<em>avowed</em> intention of lowering the
price of corn to our manufacturers, by encouraging the importation of
corn from abroad<a href="#-ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[a]</a> for the
purpose of feeding<a href="#-ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[b]</a> our own
people at a cheaper rate.” James Anderson, <em>A Calm
Investigation of the Circumstances that have led to the Present
Scarcity of Grain in Britain</em>, London, 1801, p. 50.)</p>
<p>Thus Anderson’s publication was a polemic on behalf of the
interests of the agriculturists (protection) (inclusive of the
landlords) against the interests of the manufacturers.  And he
published it “avowedly” as such a partisan piece of
writing.  The theory of rent comes in here only
incidentally.  In his later writings which are to a greater or
lesser degree continuously concerned with this <em>battle of
interests</em> he merely repeats the theory of rent once or twice in
passing.  He never pretends to a scientific interest in it and it
does not even become an
<em>independent</em> subject in his presentation.  Accordingly one
may judge the correctness of the following remarks of <em>Wilhelm
Thukydides Roscher</em> who was evidently <em>not</em> acquainted with
Anderson’s writings:</p>
<p class="quote">“Remarkable, how a doctrine which in 1777
remained
<em>almost</em> unnoticed, was immediately defended and attacked with
the greatest interest in 1815 and the following years because it
touched upon the contradiction between monied and landed interest
which had meanwhile so sharply developed.” (<em>Die Grundlagen
der Nationalökonomie</em>, 3rd edition, 1858, pp. 207-98.)</p>
<p>This sentence contains as many falsehoods as words. 
<em>Firstly</em>, unlike West, Malthus and Ricardo, Anderson did not put
forward his opinion as a “<em>doctrine”. 
Secondly</em>, it remained not ‘<em>almost</em>”, but
“<em>entirely</em>” unnoticed. 
<em>Thirdly</em>, it first came in incidentally in a work whose <em>s o l
e purpose</em> it was to deal with the contradiction between
manufacturers and landlords—a contradiction which was
considerably developed in 1777 and the ‘work only “touched
upon” this practical battle of interests and left
“untouched” the general <span class="context">||500|</span> theory of political economy. 
<em>Fourthly</em>, in 1815 one of the reproducers of this theory,
Malthus, expounded it just as much in support of the corn laws as
Anderson had done. 
<em>The same</em> doctrine was used <em>in support</em> of landed property
by its discoverer and [by] Malthus, but was turned <em>against</em>
landed property by Ricardo.  Thus, at most, one might say that
some of those who put it forward were
<em>defending</em> the interests of landed property while others who put
it forward <em>fought those same</em> interests, but one could not say
that this theory was attacked by the defenders of landed property in
1815 (for Malthus defended it <em>before</em> Ricardo), or that it was
<em>defended</em> by the attackers of landed property for Ricardo did
not have to “defend” this theory against Malthus, since he
himself regarded Malthus as one of its discoverers and as his own
forerunner.  He only had to “combat” the practical
conclusions that were drawn by Malthus). 
<em>Fifthly</em>, the contradiction between “<em>monied</em>”
and “<em>landed interest</em>”, ‘touched upon”
by Wilhelm Thukydides Roscher had up to that moment, <em>absolutely
nothing</em> to do either with Anderson’s theory of rent or with its
reproduction, defence and attack.  As Wilhelm Thukydides could
have gathered from John Stuart Mill (<em>Essays on Some Unsettled
Questions of Political Economy</em>, London, 1844, pp. 109-10), by
“monied class” the Englishman understands l.  the
money-lenders; and 2.  these money-lenders are people who either
live altogether on interest or are
<em>money-lenders by profession</em>, such as bankers, bill-brokers
etc.  Mill also observes that all these people who form the
“monied class” are opposed to, or at any rate are distinct
from, the “<em>producing class</em>” (by which Mill
understands “industrial capitalists” besides the working
men).  Hence Wilhelm Thukydides should see that the interests of
the “producing class”, including the manufacturers, the
industrial capitalists, and the interests of the monied class are two
very different matters and that these classes are different
classes.  Furthermore, Wilhelm Thukydides should see that a
battle between the industrial capitalists and the landlords was thus
by no means a battle between the “<em>monied</em> interest”
and the “<em>landed</em> interest”.  If Wilhelm
Thukydides knew the history of the corn laws of 1815 and the struggle
over these, then he would already have known from Cobbett that the
borough-mongers (landed interest) and the loan-mongers (monied
interest) combined against the industrial interest.  But Cobbett
is “crude”.  Furthermore, Wilhelm Thukydides should
know from the history of 1815 to 1847 that in the battle over the corn
laws, the majority of the monied interest and some even of the
commercial interest (Liverpool for instance) were to be found amongst
the
<em>allies</em> of the landed interest against the manufacturing
interest.  <span class="context">|500||</span></p>
<p><span class="context">||502|</span> (At most Herr Roscher might
have been surprised that <em>the same</em> “doctrine” served
<em>in favour</em> of “landed interest” in 1777 and
<em>against</em> it in 1815 and that it caused a stir only
<em>then</em>.  <span class="context">|502||</span></p>
<p><span class="context">||500|</span> If I were to elucidate in equal
detail all similar gross falsifications of history which Wilhelm
Thukydides commits in his literary historical notes, then I would have
to write as fat a volume as his <em>Grundlagen</em>, and indeed, such a
work would not be worth the paper it was written upon”. 
But the harmful effects which such learned ignorance as that of a
Wilhelm Thukydides can have on researchers in other fields of
knowledge, can be seen in the example of Herr <em>Adolf
Bastian</em>.  In his work <em>Der Mensch in der Geschichte</em>,
1860, Vol. I, p. 374, Note, he quotes the above sentence of Wilhelm
Thukydides as documentary proof for a “psychological”
assertion.  Incidentally, one cannot say of Bastian that
“<em>materiam superabat opus</em>”<a href="#-ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[c]</a>.  Rather, in this case, the
“opus” does not master its own raw material. 
Besides, I have found out through the few sciences which I
“know”, that Herr <em>Bastion</em> who knows
“<em>all</em>” sciences, very often relies on such
authorities as Wilhelm Thukydides, which is in any case unavoidable in
a “pantologist’.</p>
<p><span class="context">||501|</span> I hope I shall not be accused
of “unkindness” towards Wilhelm Thukydides.  Note the
“unkindness” with which this pedant himself treats
science!  Anyhow, I have the same right to speak of his
“total untruths” as he has to speak in his self-satisfied
and condescending manner of Ricardo’s “half-truths”. 
Furthermore, Wilhelm Thukydides is by no means “honest” in
his research and cataloguing.  Anyone who is not
“respectable” does not exist for him historically
either.  For instance, Rodbertus does not exist for him as a
theoretician of rent because he is a ‘communist”. 
Besides, Wilhelm Thukydides is also inaccurate when it comes to
“respectable writers”.  For instance, Bailey exists
for McCulloch, who even regards his work as epoch-making.  For
Wilhelm Thukydides he does not exist.  If the <em>science</em>
|502| of political economy is to he furthered and popularised in
Germany, people like Rodbertus should found a journal which would be
open to all scholars (not pedants, prigs and vulgarisers) and whose
main purpose it would be to demonstrate the ignorance of the
specialists in the science itself as well as in its history. 
<span class="context">|502||</span></p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||501|</span> Anderson was in no way
concerned with any inquiry into the relationship of his theory of rent
to the system of political economy.  This is not in the least
surprising, since his first book appeared one year after Adam Smith’s
<em>Wealth of Nations</em>, i.e., at a moment when the “system of
political economy” was only first being consolidated, for
Steuart’s system too had only appeared a few years before, But so far
as the material is concerned, which Anderson <em>examined, within the
confines of the specific subject he was considering, this was
decidedly more extensive than Ricardo’s</em>.  Just as in his
theory of money, the reproduction of Hume’s theory, Ricardo
specifically only took into account the events from 1797 to 1809, so
in the theory of rent, the reproduction of Anderson’s theory, he
considered only the economic phenomena relating to the rise in corn
prices between 1800 and 1815.</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p>The following paragraphs are very important because they clearly
reflect Ricardo’s character:</p>
<p class="quote">“I shall […] greatly regret that
<em>considerations for any particular class</em>, are allowed to cheek
the progress of the wealth and population of he country.” (David
Ricardo, <em>An Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the
Profits of Stock</em>, second edition, London, 1815, p.  49.)</p>
<p>With free import of corn, “<em>land is abandoned</em>”
(l.c., p.  46).  In other words landed property is sacrificed to
the development of production.</p>
<p>In connection with the free import of corn (he writes) however:</p>
<p class="quote">“That <em>some capital would be lost</em> cannot
be disputed, but <em>is the possession or preservation of capital</em>
the end, or the means?  The means, undoubtedly.  What we
want is an <em>abundance of commodities</em>” (wealth in general)
“and if it could he proved that by <em>the sacrifice of a part of
our capital we should augment the annual produce</em> of those objects
which contribute to our enjoyment and happiness we ought not
[…] to repine <em>at the loss of a part of our
capital</em>,” David Ricardo, <em>On Protection to
Agriculture</em>, 4th ed., London, 1822, p. 60.)</p>
<p>Ricardo terms as “<em>our capital</em>” that capital
which belongs neither to <em>us</em> nor to <em>him</em> but which has
been permanently invested in the land <em>by the capitalists</em>. 
But <em>we</em> signifies a cross-section of the nation.  The increase
in “<em>our</em>” wealth is the increase in <em>social</em>
wealth, which is an end as such, irrespective of who are the
participants in this wealth!</p>
<p class="quote">“To an individual with a capital of
£20,000, whose profits were £2,000 per annum, it would be
a mailer quite indifferent whether his capital would employ a hundred
or a thousand men, whether the commodity produced, sold for
£l0,000, or for £20,000, provided, in all cases, his
profits were not diminished below £2,000.  Is not the real
interest of the nation similar?  Provided its net real income,
its rent and profits be the same, it is of no importance whether the
nation consists of ten or of twelve millions of inhabitants.”
(David Ricardo, <em>On the Principles of Political Economy, and
Taxation</em>, third edition, London, 1821, p. 416.)</p>
<p>Here the “proletariat” is sacrificed to wealth. 
In so far as it is irrelevant to the existence of wealth, its
existence is a matter of indifference to wealth.  Here
mass—mass of human beings— is worth nothing.  These
three instances exemplify <span class="context">||502|</span>
Ricardo’s scientific impartiality.</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p>{The element <em>in which</em> the capital employed in agriculture is
invested, is <em>the soil (nature</em>) etc.  Hence rent is here
equal to the excess of the <em>value</em> of the product of labour
created in this element, <em>over</em> its average price.  If, on
the other hand, an element of nature (or material) which is privately
owned by an individual, is employed <em>in</em> another sphere of
production whose (physical) basis it does not form, then the rent, if
it only comes into being through the employment of this element,
cannot consist in the excess of the <em>value</em> of this product over
the average price, but only in the excess of the <em>general</em>
average price of this product over its <em>own overage price</em>. 
For instance, a waterfall may replace the steam-engine for a
manufacturer and save him consumption of coal.  While in
possession of this waterfall, he would, for instance, constantly be
selling yarn above its overage
<em>price</em> and making an excess profit.  If the waterfall
belongs to a landowner, this excess profit accrues to him as
rent.  In his hook on rent, Mr. Hopkins observes that in
Lancashire the waterfalls not only yield rent but, according to the
degree of the natural motive power, they yield <em>differential
rent</em>.  Here rent is purely the excess of the <em>average
market-price</em> of the product over its <em>individual average
price</em>.} <span class="context">|502||</span></p>

<p><span class="context">||502|</span> {In <em>competition</em> there
are two distinct movements towards equalisation.  Capitals
<em>within</em> the same sphere of production equalise the prices of the

between <em>different</em> spheres of production.  As between these

<h3>[4.  Rodbertus’s Error Regarding the Relation Between Value
and Surplus-Value When the Costs of Production Rise]</h3>
<p>Rodbertus is altogether mistaken when he thinks that
because one commodity is <em>dearer</em> than another, thus
realising more labour-time, it must therefore—given
the same <em>rate of surplus-value or the equal exploitation
of the workers</em> in <em>the different
spheres—also</em> contain more <em>unpaid</em>
labour-time, <em>surplus labour-time</em>.  If <em>the
same</em> labour yields 1 quarter on unfertile land and 3 on
fertile (in a good or a had year alike); if the same labour
yields 1 oz of gold in land very rich in gold whereas in
less rich or exhausted land it yields only
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> oz; if the same labour-time which
produces 1 lb. of wool spins 3 lb. of wool, then, to begin
with, the values of the 1 quarter and the 3 quarters, of the
1 oz of gold and the <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> oz, of the 1
lb. of wool and the 3 lbs. of woollen yarn (minus the value
of the wool it contains) are of equal magnitude.  They
contain equal quantities of labour-time, therefore,
according to the assumption, <em>equal quantities</em> of
surplus labour-time.  True, the quantity of
surplus-labour embodied in the 1 quarter [grown on unfertile
land] is greater, but then it is only 1 quarter whereas in
the other case it is 3 quarters, or 1 lb. of wool whereas in
the other case it is 3 lbs. of woollen yarn (minus the value
of the material).  The <em>volume</em> [of
surplus-labour] is therefore the same, and the
<em>proportional quantity of surplus-value</em>, comparing the
individual commodities one with another, [is] also
equal.  According to the assumption, the amount of
labour contained in the 1 quarter or the 1 lb. of wool, is
the same as that contained in the 3 quarters or the 3
lbs. of yarn.  The capital laid out in wages is
therefore greater to exactly the same degree as the
surplus-value.  The 1 lb. of wool contains three times
as much labour as the 1 lb. of yarn.  Though the
surplus-value is three times as great, the capital laid out
in wages on which it is based is also three times as
great.  The proportion thus remains <em>the
some</em>.</p>
<p>Rodbertus calculates quite wrongly here, or wrongly
compares the capital laid out in wages with the <span class="context">||503|</span> greater or lesser quantity of
commodities which these wages represent.  But this
calculation is completely wrong, if, as he presupposes,
wages or the rote of surplus-value are given, The same
quantity of labour, say, 12 hours, may result in <em>x</em> or
3<em>x</em> commodities.  In one case, 1<em>x</em>
commodities contain as much labour and surplus-labour as
3<em>x</em> in the other; but in no case would more than 1
working-day be spent and in no case would the rate of
surplus-value be more than, say,
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub>.  In the first instance
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> of the one <em>x</em> would be
<em>x</em> to as in the second <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> of
the 3<em>x</em> would be to 3<em>x</em>.  And if we were
to call each of the three <em>x: x', x'', x'''</em> then there would be
<sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> paid and <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub>
unpaid labour in each <em>x', x'' x'''</em>. 
It is quite right, on the other hand, that if just as much
commodity were to be produced under the unproductive
conditions as under “more productive, the commodity
would contain more labour and so also more
surplus-labour.  But then, proportionately, a greater
capital would also have to be laid out.  In order to
produce 3<em>x</em>, three times as much capital would have to
he laid out (in wages) as is required to produce 1<em>x</em>.</p>
<p>Now it is true that manufacture cannot work up more raw
material than agriculture supplies.  Thus, for
instance, it cannot spin more pounds of wool than have been
produced.  If the productivity in wool spinning is
trebled, then, provided the conditions of the production of
wool remained the <em>same</em>, three times as much time as
previously would have to he spent, three times as much
capital would have to be expended on labour in wool
production, whereas only the <em>same</em> amount of the
spinners’ labour-time would be required to spin up this
trebled quantity of wool.  But the <em>rate</em> [of
surplus-value] would remain the same.  The same
spinning labour would have the same value as before and
contain the same surplus-value.  The wool-producing
labour would have a <em>trebled</em> surplus-value but the
labour embodied in it, or the capital advanced in wages,
would accordingly have trebled as well.  The three
times greater surplus-value would thus be calculated on a
three times greater capital.  But <em>this is no
reason</em> for saying that the rate of surplus-value is
1ower in spinning than in wool production.  One would
only say that the capital laid out in wages is three times
as great in one as in the other (since it is assumed here
that the changes in the spinning and in the production of
wool are not due to any change in their constant
capital).</p>
<p>It is necessary to make a distinction here.  The
same labour plus constant capital gives a smaller
<em>output</em> in an unfavourable than a favourable season,
in unproductive than in productive soil, in a poorer than in
a richer mine.  In the former case the <em>product</em>
is thus dearer, contains <em>more</em> labour and more
<em>surplus-labour</em> in the same number of products. 
But in the latter case, the number of these products is the
greater.  Furthermore, the <em>ratio</em> between paid
and unpaid labour in each individual product in the two
categories is not affected by this, for though the
individual product contains less unpaid labour, according to
the assumption, it also contains less paid labour in the
same proportion.  For it has been assumed here that
there is no change in the proportions of the organic
component parts of capital—<em>of variable and constant
capital.  It is assumed that the same amount of
variable and constant capital</em> supplies<em> varying,
greater or smaller, quantities of product</em> under varying
conditions.</p>
<p>Herr Rodbertus appears to confuse this all the time, and
as a matter of course to conclude from the mere increase in
the price of the product that it contains a <em>greater
surplus-value</em>.  As to the <em>rate</em>, this is
wrong even according to the assumption.  As to the
total, however, it is only right if more capital is advanced
in one case than in the other, that means if as much is
produced now of the dearer product as previously of the
cheaper or if the increased quantity of the cheaper product
(as above with spinning) presupposes a correspondingly
increased quantity of the dearer product.</p>

<h3>[5.  Ricardo’s Denial of Absolute Rent—a
Result of His Error in the Theory of Value]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||504|</span> That rent, hence also
the value of land, can rise, although the <em>rate of
rent</em> remains the same or even decreases, that therefore
the productivity of agriculture also increases—this
Ricardo sometimes forgets, though he knows it.  Anyhow,
Anderson knows it and Petty and D’Avenant already knew
it.  That is not the question.</p>
<p>Ricardo abstracts from <em>the question of absolute
rent</em> which he <em>denies on theoretical grounds</em>
because he starts out from the <em>false</em> assumption that
if the value of commodities is determined by labour-time,
the <em>average prices of commodities must equal their
values</em> (which is why he comes to the wrong practical
conclusion.  that competition from more fertile types
of land must throw the less fertile out of cultivation, even
if they bore rent previously).  If <em>values</em> of
commodities and <em>average prices</em> of commodities were
identical then absolute rent—i.e., rent on the worst
cultivated land or on that <em>originally</em>
cultivated—would be equally impossible.  What is
the <em>average price</em> of the commodity?  The total
capital (constant plus variable) laid out in its production
plus the labour-time contained in the average profit, say 10
per cent.  Supposing, that a capital produced a
<em>higher value</em> than the <em>average price</em>, just
because it was operating in a <em>particular</em> element, an
element of nature, say land, then the value of this
commodity would be <em>above</em> its value and this <em>excess
value</em> would contradict the conception of value being
equal to a certain quantity of labour-time.  An element
of nature, something heterogeneous from social labour-time
would he <em>creating</em> value.  But this cannot
be.  Hence capital invested in land pure and simple
<em>cannot</em> bear a <em>rent</em>.  The worst land is
land <em>pure and simple</em>.  If the <em>better</em> land
bears a rent, then this only shows that the difference
between the <em>individually necessary</em> labour and that
which is <em>socially necessary</em> becomes permanently
established in agriculture because it has a natural basis,
whereas in industry it is constantly disappearing.</p>
<p><em>Absolute rent</em> cannot be permitted to exist, but
only <em>differential rent</em>.  To admit the existence
of absolute rent would be to admit that <em>the same quantity
of labour</em> (materialised, laid out in constant capital
and bought with wages) creates <em>varying values</em>
according to the element in which [the labour is expended]
or according to the material which it works up.  But if
one admits this <em>diversity in value</em> although in each
sphere of production <em>the same</em> amount of labour-time
materialises itself in the product, then one admits that
<em>value is not determined by labour-time</em> but by
something heterogeneous.  These different <em>magnitudes
of value</em> would invalidate the concept of value, they
would invalidate the proposition that the substance of value
is social labour-time, hence its differences can only be
quantitative and these quantitative differences can only be
equal to the differences in the amounts of social
labour-time applied.</p>
<p>The maintenance of <em>value—the</em> determination
not only of the amount of value by the varying amount of
labour-time, but also of the substance of value by social
labour—thus requires the <em>denial of absolute
rent</em>.  The denial of absolute rent can, however, be
expressed in two ways.</p>
<p><em>Firstly</em>.  The <em>worst</em> land cannot bear a
rent.  The rent from the better types of land can be
explained as arising from the market-price which is the same
for products which have been produced on more favourable
types of land as for those which have been produced on less
favourable.  But the worst land <em>is land pure and
simple</em>.  It is not differentiated in itself. 
It differs from industrial capital investment only in that
it is a <em>special</em> sphere of capital investment. 
If it bore a rent then this would arise from the fact that
the <em>same quantity of labour</em> would produce
<em>different values</em>, if applied in <em>different spheres
of production;</em> this means that the quantity of labour in
itself does not determine the value, and products which
contain the same amount of labour are not equal [in terms of
value].</p>
<p><span class="context">||505|</span> [<em>Secondly.</em>] Or
one might say that the <em>land which was cultivated
originally</em> must not bear rent.  For what is the
originally cultivated land?  The land which is
“originally’ cultivated is neither better nor
worse land; it is land pure and simple. 
Undifferentiated land.  Originally, capital investment
in agriculture can only differ from investment in industry
because of the <em>spheres</em> in which these capitals are
invested.  But since equal quantities of labour are
represented in <em>equal values</em>, there is absolutely no
reason why the capital invested in land should yield a rent
in addition to profit, unless <em>the same</em> quantity of
labour applied in this <em>sphere</em> produced a higher
value, so that the excess of this value over the value
yielded in manufacture would produce an excess profit, equal
to rent.  But this would amount to saying that the land
as such creates value, thus invalidating the concept of
value itself.</p>
<p>The land which is cultivated <em>originally</em> therefore
cannot <em>originally</em> bear a rent, if the whole theory of
value is not to he discarded.  Furthermore, this ties
up very easily (<em>although not necessarily</em>, as Anderson
shows) with the idea that <em>originally</em> people of course
chose not the worst but rather the best land for
cultivation, With the advance of civilisation and
population, the land which originally hears no rent, does so
at a later stage, because people are forced to descend to
worse types of land and thus in this descent to Avernus, to
ever worse land, rent must arise on the <em>originally
cultivated, most fertile land</em>.  And then, step by
step, on the land which follows it, while the <em>worst
land</em> which always represents simply land—the
<em>particular</em> sphere of capital investment—never
bears a rent.  All this has a more or less logical
coherence.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, one knows that average prices and
values are not identical, that the average price of a
commodity may be either equal to its value or bigger or
smal1er, then the question, the problem itself, disappears
and with it also the <em>hypotheses</em> for its
solution.  The only remaining question is why, in
agriculture, the <em>value</em> of the <em>commodity</em>, or at
any rate its <em>price</em>, is <em>above its average price</em>
though not <em>above</em> its <em>value</em>.  But this
question no longer bears any relation to the fundamentals of
the theory, the determination of value as such.</p>
<p>Ricardo knows of course that the “<em>relative</em>
values” of commodities are modified according to the
varying proportion of fixed capital and capital laid out in
wages, which enter into their production.  &lt;But
these are not opposites; fixed capital and circulating
capital are opposites, and circulating capital comprises not
only wages but also raw materials and auxiliary
materials.  For example, the same ratio may exist
between capital laid out in wages and fixed capital in the
mining and fishing industries, as between that laid out in
wages and in raw materials in tailoring.&gt; But Ricardo
also knows that these relative values are equalised by
competition.  In fact he only makes the
differentiation, so that <em>the same average profit</em>
should result from these different capital
investments.  In other words these <em>relative</em>
values of which he speaks are only the <em>average
prices</em>.  It does not even occur to him that
<em>value</em> and <em>average price</em> are different. 
He only gets as far as their <em>identity</em>.  Since
however this identity <em>does</em> not <em>exist</em> when the
ratio of the organic component parts of capital varies, he
accepts it as an unexplained fact brought about by
competition.  Hence too, he does not come up against
the question: Why do the values of agricultural products not
equalise in average prices?  <span class="context">||506|</span> On the contrary he assumes
that <em>they do so</em> and poses the problem from that point
of view.</p>
<p>It is quite incomprehensible why fellows á la
Wilhelm Thukydides should be so ardently for Ricardo’s
theory of rent.  From <em>their</em> point of view,
Ricardo’s “half truths”, as Thukydides
condescendingly calls then, lose their <em>whole</em>
value.</p>
<p>For Ricardo the problem only exists because value is
determined by labour-time.  With those fellows this is
not the case.  According to Roscher, nature <em>as
such</em> has value.  See Later.  In other words,
he has absolutely no idea what value is.  What prevents
him therefore from allowing the <em>value of land</em> to
enter into production costs from the outset and to form the
rent; what prevents him from presupposing the value of land,
i.e., rent as an explanation for rent?</p>
<p>With these fellows, the phrase “production
costs” is meaningless.  We see this with
Say.  The value of the commodity is determined by the
costs of production, capital, land, labour.  But these
are determined by demand and supply.  In other words,
no determination is taking place.  Since the land
performs productive “services”, why should not the price of
these “services” be determined by demand and
supply, just as the services performed by labour or
capital?  And since the “land services” are
in the possession of certain sellers, why should their
article not have a market-price, in other words why should
not rent exist as an element of price?</p>
<p>One can see how lime reason Wilhelm Thukydides had for
getting so well-meaningly “vexed” over the
Ricardian theory.</p>
<p><a name="s6"> </a></p>
<h3>[6.  Ricardo’s Thesis on the Constant Rise in Corn
Prices.  Table of Annual Average Prices of Corn from
1641 to 1859]</h3>
<p>But apart from absolute rent, the following question
remains for Ricardo:</p>
<p>The population grows and with it the demand for
agricultural products.  Therewith their price rises, as
happens in similar cases in industry.  But in industry,
this rise in price ceases as soon as demand has become
effective and brought about an increased supply of
commodities.  The product now falls to the old, or
rather below the old, level of value.  But in
agriculture this <em>additional product</em> is thrown on to
the market neither at the same price nor at a 1ower
price.  <em>It costs more</em> and effects a constant
rise in market-prices and along with that, a raising of
rent.  How is this to be explained if not by the fact
that ever less fertile types of land are being used, that
ever more labour is required in order to produce the same
product, that agriculture becomes progressively more
sterile?  Why, apart from the influence of the
depreciation [of money], did agricultural products rise in
England from 1797 to 1815 with the rapid development of the
population?  That they fell again later proves
nothing.  That supplies from foreign markets were cut
off proves nothing.  On the contrary.  This in
fact created the <em>right</em> conditions for demonstrating
the effect of the law of rent as such.  For it was the
very cutting off of foreign supplies which forced the
country to have recourse <em>to ever less fertile
land</em>.  This cannot be explained by an <em>absolute
increase</em> in rent, because not only did the rental rise
but also the rate of rent.  The quarter of wheat,
etc. rose in price.</p>
<p>It cannot be explained by <em>depreciation</em> because
although this might well explain why, with greater
productivity in industry, industrial products fell, hence
why the relative price of agricultural products rose, it
would not explain why <em>in addition</em> to this <em>relative
rise</em>, the prices of agricultural products were
continuously rising absolutely.  Similarly, it cannot
be explained as a <em>consequence</em> of the fall in the rate
of profit.  This would <em>never</em> explain a change in
<em>prices</em>, but only a <em>change</em> in the distribution
of value or of <em>price</em> between landlord, manufacturer
and worker.</p>
<p>So far as <em>depreciation</em> is concerned, assume that
£ 1 now equals £2.  A quarter of wheat
which was previously equal to £2 is now equal to
£4.  If the industrial product fell to
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub>, and previously its value was
20s., then it would be now 2s.  But these 2s. are now
equal to 4s.  True, depreciation could have something
to do with this, the poor harvests as well.</p>
<p><span class="context">||507|</span> But quite apart from
all this it can he assumed that, considering the <em>state of
agriculture at that time, unfertile</em> land (for wheat) was
being cultivated.  The sane land was later fertile, in
that the rate of differential rents decreased, as is proved
by the best barometer, namely, wheat prices.</p>
<p>The highest prices [occur in the years] 1800 and 1801 and
1811 and 1812; the first were years of poor growth, the
second, [years] of the peak of depreciation.  Similarly
1817 and 1818 were years of depreciation.  But if these
years are omitted, probably (to be checked up later) what
was left would give the average price.</p>
<p>In comparing wheat prices etc. in different periods, it
is at the same time important to compare the <em>amounts
produced at</em> so much per quarter, because this shows to
what extent the additional production of corn influences the
price.</p>

<p><em>West</em> says himself:</p>
<p class="quote">“…in an improved state of
agriculture produce may be raised on the second or third
quality of land at the little cost as it could under the old
system upon the first quality.” (Sir Edward West,
<em>Price of Corn and wages of Labour, London</em>, 1826,
p. 98.)</p>
<p><a name="s7"> </a></p>
<h3>[7.  Hopkins’s Conjecture about the Difference
Between Absolute Rent and Differential Rent; Explanation of
Rent by the Private Ownership of Land]</h3>
<p><em>Hopkins</em> grasps correctly the difference between
<em>absolute</em> and <em>differential rent:</em></p>
<p class="quote">“The principle of competition, which
renders it impossible, that there should be two rates of
profit in the same country […], does […]
determine[…] their<a href="#-ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[d]</a> [..]  <em>relative
rents…</em>” but not the <em>general average of
rent</em><a href="#-ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><b>[e]</b></a>.  (Thomas Hopkins,
<em>On Rent of Land, and Its Influence on Subsistence and
Population</em>…, London, 1828, p. 30.)</p>
<p><span class="context">||508a|</span> <em>Hopkins</em> makes
the following distinction between productive and
unproductive labour or, as he says, between primary and
secondary:</p>
<p class="quote">“If <em>all</em> labourers were
employed for the same end, or object, as the diamond cutter
and the opera singer, in a short time there would be no
<em>wealth</em> to subsist them because <em>none</em> of the
<em>wealth produced would then become capital</em>.  If a
considerable proportion were so employed, wages would be
low; be cause, but a comparatively small part of what was
produced would be used as capital;—but if only a few
of the labourers were so employed, and of course, nearly all
were ploughmen, shoemakers, weavers, etc. […, then
much capital would be produced and wages <em>would</em><a href="#-ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><b>[f]</b></a> be proportionally high” (l.c.,
pp. 84-85).  “With the diamond cutter and the
singer, must be classed all those who labour for the
landlords, or annuitants, and who receive a part of their
income as wages: all, in fact, whose labours
<em>terminate</em> merely in producing those things which
gratify landlords and annuitants, and who receive in return
for their labours, a part of the rent of the landlord, or of
the income of the annuitant.  These are all productive
labourers, but all their labours are for the purpose of
converting wealth which exists, in the shape of rents and
annuities, into some other form, that shall, in that other
form, more gratify the landlord and annuitant, and therefore
they are <em>secondary</em> producers.  All other
labourers are <em>primary</em> producers”(l.c.,
p. 85.)</p>
<p>Diamonds and song are both congealed labour and
can—like all commodities—be converted into
<em>money</em> and as <em>money</em> into capital.  But in
this transformation of money into capital we must
distinguish two things.  All commodities can be
converted into money and as money into capital, because in
the form of <em>money</em> their use-value and their
particular natural form become extinct.  They are
materialised labour in that social form in which it is
exchangeable for any real labour, therefore convertible into
any form of real labour.  On the other hand, whether
the commodities which are the product of labour can as such
become elements of productive capital once again, depends on
whether the nature of their use-values permits them to
re-enter the process of production—be it as objective
conditions of labour (tools and material) or as subjective
conditions (means of subsistence of the worker), (in other
words [as] elements of constant or of variable capital).</p>
<p>In Ireland, according to a moderate estimate and the
census of 1821, the whole net produce which goes to the
landlords, the government and the tythe-owners, amounts to
<em>£20 <sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub></em> million, the
whole wages, however, only to £14,114.000.<a href="#-ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[g]</a></p>
<p class="quote">“The cultivators” in Italy
“generally paying from one-half to more than one-half
of the produce as rent to the landlord, with moderate skill
in agriculture, and a scanty supply of fixed capital. 
The greater part of the population is […] composed of
secondary producers and proprietors,<a href="#-ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[h]</a> and generally the primary producers
are a poor and degraded class” (l.c., pp.
101-102).</p>
<p>The same was the case in France under Louis XIV [XV and
XVI].  According to Young, rent, tythes and taxes
amounted to £140,905,304.  Cultivation moreover
was very poor.  The population of France, at this time,
is stated to have been 26,363,074.  Now” if there
had been “six millions of labouring families (which is
too high a figure), each family would have had to furnish
annually, either directly or indirectly, an average of
upwards of £23 of net wealth to the landlords. 
The church and the government.<a href="#-ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[i]</a> According to Young, and taking into
account various other factors, the laboring family
“produced annually £42 l0s.; £23 of which
were paid away to others, and £19 l0s. remained to
subsist itself” (l.c., pp. 102-04).</p>
<p>The Dependence of Population on Capital.</p>
<p class="quote">“The error of Mr. Malthus and his
followers is to be found in the assumption, that a reduction
of the labouring population would not be followed by a
correspondent reduction of capital”(l.c., p.l18.)
“…Mr. Malthus” forgets “that this
demand [for labourers is] limited by the means of paging
wages and” that “these means do not arise
spontaneously, but are always previously created by
labour” (l.c., p. 122).</p>
<p>This conception of the accumulation of capital is
correct.  But the means can grow, i.e., the quantity of
surplus produce or surplus-labour can grow, without a
proportionate growth in the quantity of labour.</p>
<p>“It is somewhat extraordinary<a href="#-ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[j]</a>  that that [there is] a strong
inclination […] to represent <em>net</em> wealth
as <em>beneficial</em> to the labouring class, because it
gives […] <em>employment</em> though it is evidently
<span class="context">||509|</span> not on account of being
<em>net</em>, that if has that power, but because it is
wealth,—that <em>which has been brought into existence
by labour:</em> while, at the time,<a href="#-ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[k]</a> an additional quantity of labour is
represented as <em>injurious to</em> the labouring classes,
though that labour produces three times as much as it
consumes” (l.c., p. 120).</p>
<p>‘If by the use of superior machines,<a href="#-ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[l]</a> the whole primary
produce could he raised from 200 to 250 or 300, while
<em>net</em> wealth and profit took only 140, it is clear that
there would remain as a fund for the wages of the primary
producers 110 or 160 instead of 60” (l.c.,
p. 128).</p>
<p class="quote">“The condition of labourers is
rendered <em>bad</em> either by crippling their productive
power, or by taking from them what they have produced”
(l.c., p.  129).</p>
<p class="quote">“No says Mr. Malthus ‘the
<em>weight of your burthen</em> has nothing whatever to do
with your distress; that arises solely there being too
<em>many persons carrying it</em>…’” l.c.,
p. 184).</p>
<p class="quote">“In the general principle, then, that
<em>cost of production</em> regulates the exchangeable value
of all commodities, <em>original materials</em> are not
included: but the claim which the <em>owners</em> of these
have upon produce, causes <em>rent</em> to enter into
value(Thomas Hopkins, <em>Economical Enquiries Relative to
the Laws Which Regulate Rent Profit, Wages, and the
Value of Money</em>, London, 1822, p. 11).</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>Rent</em>, or a charge for use,
arises naturally out of <em>ownership</em>, or the
establishment of a <em>right of property</em>” (l.c.,
p. 13).</p>
<p class="quote">“Any thing may yield a rent if
possessed of the following qualifies:— First,—It
must exist in a degree of scarcity.  Secondly,—It
must have the power to aid labour in the great work of
production” (l.c., p. 14).  Of course one must
not take the case “…where land… [is] so
plentiful, <em>compared with the labour</em> and <em>stock to
be employed upon it</em> (abundance and scarcity of land are
of course <em>relative</em>, and are related to the disposable
quantity of labour and capital) ‘that no charge for
rent could be made, because it was not scarce” (l.c.,
p. 21).</p>
<p class="quote">“The landowner<a href="#-ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[m]</a> […] may obtain, in some
countries 50 per cent […] in others 10 per cent.<a href="#-ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[n]</a> In some of the
fertile regions of the East, man can subsist upon one-third
of the produce of his labour employed upon the land:
[…] but in parts of Switzerland and Norway, an
exaction of 10 per cent might depopulate the country
… we see no <em>natural</em> bounds to the rent that
may be exacted, but in the limited abilities of the
payers…“ (l.c., p. 31), and “where<a href="#-ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[o]</a> inferior soils
exist, <em>the competition of those inferior soils against
the superior</em>” (l.c., pp. 33.34).</p>
<p class="quote">“There is much common land in England
[…], the natural fertility of which is equal to what
a large part <em>of the land now cultivated was, prior to its
being taken into cultivation;</em> and yet <em>the expence of
bringing such common lands into cultivation</em> is so great,
<em>as to cause them not to yield the ordinary interest for
the money expended in improving them</em>, leaving <em>nothing
as rent for the natural fertility of the soil:</em> and this
[…] with all the advantages of an immediate
application of labour, aided by stock skilfully applied, and
furnished with manufactures cheaply produced; added to the
very important circumstance, of good roads being already
formed in the neighbourhood<a href="#-ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[p]</a>… the present land
proprietors may be considered <em>the owners of all the
accumulated labour which has for ages been expending,<a href="#-ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><b>[q]</b></a> in bringing
the country</em> to <em>its present productive
state</em>” (l.c., p.  35).</p>
<p>This is a very important circumstance in relation to
rent, especially when the population suddenly grows
significantly, as it did from 1780 to 1815, consequent upon
the advance in industry, and hence a large portion of
hitherto uncultivated land is <em>suddenly</em> brought into
cultivation.  The newly cultivated land may be as
fertile as or even more fertile than old land was, <em>before
centuries of cultivation</em> had accumulated in it. 
But what is demanded of the new land—if [this product]
is <em>not</em> to be sold at a dearer price—is that its
fertility must he equal <em>firstly</em> to the natural
fertility of the cultivated <span class="context">||510|</span> land and <em>secondly</em> to
the <em>artificial</em> fertility which has been engendered by
cultivation, hut which has now <em>become</em> its <em>natural
fertility</em>.  The newly cultivated land would thus
have to be much more fertile than the old had been
<em>before</em> its cultivation.</p>
<p>But it will be said:</p>
<p>The fertility of the cultivated land originates in the
first place from its natural fertility.  Thus it
depends on the natural condition of the newly cultivated
land whether or not it possesses this fertility arising from
and owing to nature.  In either ease it costs
nothing.  The other part of the fertility of cultivated
land is an artificial product, owing to cultivation, the
investment of capital.  But this part of productivity
involves costs of production which are repaid as interest on
the fixed capital which has been sunk into the land. 
This part of rent is merely interest on the fixed capital
tied up in the land.  Hence it enters into the costs of
production of the product of the previously cultivated
land.  Hence only the same capital needs to be thrown
into the newly cultivated land for it to obtain this second
part of fertility; and as with the first, the interest on
the capital which has been employed to bring forth this
fertility will enter into the price of the product. 
Why then should it not he possible to cultivate new
land—unless it is more fertile—without the price
of the product rising?  If the natural fertility is the
same, then the difference is brought about only by the
capital invested and, in both cases alike, the interest on
this capital enters into costs of production to the same
extent.</p>
<p>However, this reasoning is wrong.  A portion of the
<em>costs</em> of bringing the land into cultivation etc, is
no longer liable to be paid for, because, as <em>Ricardo</em>
has already observed, the fertility thus created has partly
coalesced with the <em>natural quality</em> of the soil (this
applies to the costs of clearing, draining, levelling, the
chemical change of the soil resulting from continued
chemical processes etc.).  Thus if [the product of] the
newly cultivated land is to sell at the same price as [that
of] the last cultivated land— the land must he
sufficiently fertile for this <em>price</em> to cover that
part of the costs of bringing it into cultivation which
enters into its own costs of production but which has ceased
to enter into the <em>costs</em> of the previously cultivated
land, because it has coalesced with the natural fertility of
the land.</p>
<p>‘“A <em>stream</em>, favourably situated,
furnishes an instance of a rent being paid for an
appropriated gift of nature, of as exclusive a kind
as any that can be named.  This is well understood in
manufacturing districts, where considerable rents are paid
for small streams of water, particularly if the fall is
considerable.  The power obtained from such streams
being equal to that afforded by large steam-engines, it is
as advantageous to use them, though subject to the payment
of a heavy rent, as it is to expend large sums in the
erection and working of steam-engines.  Of streams,
too, there are some larger, some smaller.  Contiguity
to the seat of manufacture is also an advantage which
commands a higher rent.  In the counties of York and
Lancaster there is probably a much greater difference
between the rents paid for the smallest and the largest
streams of water, than there is between the rents paid for
50 of the least and 50 of the most fertile acres that are in
common cultivation” (l.c., pp. 37-38).</p>
<p><a name="s8"> </a></p>
<h3>[8.  The Costs of Bringing Land into
Cultivation.  Periods of Rising and Periods of Falling
Corn Prices (1641-1859)]</h3>
<p>If we compare the average prices given earlier and deduct
firstly what is due to depreciation (1809-13) and secondly
what is due to particularly bad seasons such as 1800 and
1801, then [we shall find] that a very important element is
<em>the amount of new land</em> cultivated at a given moment
or during a given period.  A rise in price on the
cultivated land here indicates a <em>growth in population</em>
and hence an excess in price (as compared with costs): on
the other hand, the same increase in demand brings about the
cultivation of fresh land.  If <em>proportionately</em>
the amount [of newly cultivated land] has greatly increased,
then the rising price, and the <em>higher price</em>, in the
early period merely shows that a large part of the <em>costs
of bringing land into cultivation</em> enters into the
additional quantity of food produced.  If the price had
not risen, this production [of additional food] would not
have taken place.  Its effect, a fall in price, can
only come into evidence later, because the price of the
recently created food comprises an element of the cost of
production or price, that has long become extinct in the
older applications of capital to land, or in the older
portions of cultivated soil.  The difference would be
even greater if consequent upon the increased productivity
of labour, the cost of appropriating soil to cultivation,
had not greatly fallen, as compared to the costs of
cultivation in former, bygone periods.</p>
<p><span class="context">||511|</span> The transformation of
new land, whether more or equally or less fertile than old
land, into such a state (and this state is given by the
general rate of adaptation to culture prevailing on the
existing land under cultivation) as <em>to make it</em>
suitable for the application of capital and
labour—under <em>the game conditions</em> under which
capital and labour is employed on the average quantity of
cultivated soil—this adaptation must he paid for by
the costs of converting waste land into cultivated
land.  This difference of cost must he borne by the
newly cultivated land.  If it does not enter into the
price of its produce, there are only two eases possible,
under which such a result can be realised. 
<em>Either</em> the produce of the newly cultivated land is
not sold at its <em>real value</em>.  Its price stands
below its value, as is in fact the case with most of the
land bearing no rent, because its price is not constituted
by <em>its own value</em>, but by the value of the produce
derived from more fertile soils.  <em>Or</em> the newly
cultivated land must be <em>so fertile</em>, that, if it was
sold at its immanent, own value, according to the quantity
of labour realised in it, it would be sold at a less price
than the price of produce grown on the formerly cultivated
soil.</p>
<p>If the difference between the <em>inherent value</em> [of
its product] and the <em>market-price</em> settled by the
value of the cultivated soil is such, that it <em>amounted
for instance to 5</em> per cent and if on the other hand the
<em>interest</em>, entering into its costs of production on
the part of the capital employed to bring it up to the level
of productive ability common to the old soils, amounted also
to 5 per cent, then the newly cultivated land would grow
produce, which at the old market-price would he able to pay
the usual wages, profits and rents.  If the interest of
the capital employed amounted to 4 per cent only while its
degree of fertility exceeded 4 per cent, as compared to the
older soils, the market-price, after the deduction of the 4
per cent interest for the capital employed to bring the new
land into a ‘cultivable” state would leave a
surplus, or it might be sold at a lower price than the
<em>market-price settled by the value of the</em> least
fruitful soil.  Rents consequently would generally be
lowered, together with the market-price of the produce.</p>
<p><em>Absolute rent</em> is the excess of <em>value</em> over
the <em>average price</em> of raw produce. 
<em>Differential rent</em> is the excess of the
<em>market-price</em> of the produce grown on favoured soils
over the <em>value</em> of their own produce.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the <em>price</em> of <em>raw produce</em>
rises or remains constant in periods in which a relatively
large part of the additional food, required by the increase
of population, is produced on soil which from uncultivated
state has been converted into a state of cultivation, this
constancy or rise of prices does not prove that the
fertility of the land has decreased, but only that it has
not increased to such a degree as to counteract the fresh
element of production—formed by the interest of
capital applied with a view to bringing the uncultivated
land to a level of the common conditions of production,
under which the old soils—in a given state of
development—are cultivated.</p>
<p>If the relative quantity of the newly cultivated soil is
different in different periods, then even a <em>constant or
rising price</em> does not prove that the new soil is
unfertile or yields <em>less produce</em>, but only that an
element of cost, which has become extinct in the old
cultivated soils enters into the value of the products of
the newly cultivated land.  This new element of cost
moreover remains, although under the new conditions of
production, the costs of bringing new soil into cultivation
have fallen considerably, compared with the costs of
bringing the old soil from its <em>original, natural</em>
state of fertility to its present state.  It is
therefore necessary to establish the <em>relative
proportion</em> of enclosures during the different <span class="context">||512|</span> periods.</p>
<p>The above list (pp. 507-08) moreover shows:</p>
<p>That of the <em>decennial</em> periods examined, the
<em>period 1641-1649</em> reaches a <em>higher</em> level than
any other decennial period up to 1860, with the exception of
the decennial periods 1800-1809 and 1810-1819.</p>
<p>So far as the <em>fifty-year periods</em> are concerned,
that of <em>1650-1699</em> is at a higher level than that of
<em>1700-1749</em> and that of <em>1750-1799</em> higher
than that of 1700-1749 and lower than that of 1800-1849 (or
1859).</p>
<p>Prices constantly fall in the period from 1810 to 1859,
whereas in the period from 1750 to 1799, despite the lower
average price over the 50 years, an upward movement (takes
place); the upward movement is just as consistent as the
downward movement between 1810 and 1859.</p>
<p>In fact, compared with the period of 1641-1649, there is,
on the whole, a continuous fall in decennial average prices,
until this fall reaches its <em>peak (lowest point</em>) in
the last two decennial periods of the first half of the 18th
century.</p>
<p><em>From the middle of the eighteenth century onwards</em>,
an upward movement takes place.  It commences from a
price (36s. <em>4 <sup class="ratio">5</sup>/10d</em>.  1750-1759),
which is lower than the 50 years average price of the second
half of the seventeenth century and approximately
corresponds (to or is) a little higher than the average
price of the 50 year period 1700-1749 (35s. 9
<sup class="ratio">29</sup>/<sub class="ratio">50</sub>d.), the <em>first</em> half of the
eighteenth century.  This upward movement continues at
an increasing pace in the two decennial periods 1800-1809
and 1810-1819.  In the latter it reaches its
acme.  From that point on, the consistent downward
movement begins again.  If we take the average of the
period of rise from 1750 to 1819, then its average price (a
little over 57s. per quarter) [is] equal to the
starting-point of the period of fail from 1820 (namely a
little over 58s, for the decennial period 1820-1829); just
as the starting-point for the second half of the 18th
century [equals] the average price of its first half.</p>
<p>Any mathematical example will show how individual
circumstances, a poor harvest, depreciation of money,
etc. can affect the average figure.  For instance,
30+20+5+5+5=65.  Average is 13, although the last three
numbers here [are] always only equal to 5.  As against
this, 12+11+10+9+8[=50], average is 10, although, if one
struck off the exceptional 30 and 20 in the first series,
the average of any three years in [the] second [series]
would he greater.</p>
<p>If one deducts the differential costs for the capital
successively employed in bringing new land into cultivation,
which for a certain period enters as an item into cost, then
perhaps the prices of 1820-1859 [would be] lower than any of
the earlier ones.  And this to some extent may well be
the notion in the heads of those fellows who explain rent as
interest for fixed capital sunk into the soil.</p>

<h3>[9.  Anderson versus Malthus.  Anderson’s
Definition of Rent.  His Thesis of the Rising
Productivity of Agriculture and Its Influence on
Differential Rent]</h3>
<p><em>Anderson</em> says in:</p>
<p><em>A Calm Investigation of the Circumstances that have
led to the Present Scarcity of Grain in Britain</em>, London,
1801:</p>
<p class="quote">“From 1700 to 1750, there has been a
regular […] fall of price […] front £2
18s, 1d, to £I 12s. 6d. per quarter of wheat;
[…] from 1750 to 1800 […] progressional rise
[…] from £1 12s. 6d. to £5 l0s. per
quarter” (p. 11).</p>
<p>Thus, unlike West, Malthus, Ricardo, he did not
one-sidedly consider the phenomenon of a rising scale of
corn prices (from 1750 to 1813), but rather the double
phenomenon, a whole century, of which the first half shows a
constantly falling and the second half a constantly rising
scale of corn prices.  He says very definitely:</p>
<p class="quote">“the population […] was on the
increase during the first half of this century<a href="#-ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[r]</a> a as well as the
last” (l.c., p. 12).</p>
<p>He is a decided enemy of the theory of population and
says explicitly that the land is capable of increasing and
perennial improvement.</p>
<p>The soil can be <em>continuously improved</em> by chemical
influences and cultivation” (l.c., p. 38)</p>
<p><span class="context">||513|</span> “…under
a judicious system of management, that productiveness<a href="#-ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[s]</a>  may be made
to augment, from year to year, for a succession of time to
which no limits can be assigned, fill at last it may be made
to attain a degree of productiveness, of which we cannot,
perhaps, at this time conceive an idea” l.c.,
pp. 35-36).</p>
<p class="quote">“…it may be with certainty
said, that the present population is such a trifle compared
to that” which this island can maintain, as to be much
below any degree of serious consideration” (l.c.,
p. 37).</p>
<p class="quote">“Wherever population increases
[…], the produce of the country must be augmented
along with it unless <em>some moral influence is permitted to
derange</em> the economy of nature” (l.c.,
p. 41).</p>
<p>The “theory of population” represents
“the most pernicious prejudice” (l.c.,
p. 54).  Anderson seeks to prove historically that the
“productivity of agriculture” rises with a
growing and falls with a declining population (I.e., pp. 55,
56, 60, 61 et seq.).</p>
<p>With a correct conception of <em>rent</em>, the first point
to arise was of course that it does not originate from the
land but from the <em>product</em> of <em>agriculture</em>, that
is, from labour, from the <em>price of the product of
labour</em>, for instance of wheat; in other words, from the
<em>value</em> of the agricultural product, from the labour
applied to the land, not from the land, and Anderson quite
correctly emphasises this.</p>
<p class="quote">“It is not […] the rent of the
land that determines the price of its produce, but it is the
price of that produce which determines the rent of the land,
although the price of that produce is often highest in those
countries where the rent of land is lowest.”</p>
<p>&lt;Rent has thus nothing to do with the <em>absolute</em>
productivity of agriculture.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“This seems to be a paradox that
deserves to be explained.  In every country there is a
variety of soils, differing considerably from one another in
point of fertility.  These we shall at present suppose
arranged into different classes, which we shall denote by
the letters A B, C, D, E, F etc., the class A comprehending
the soils of the greatest fertility, and the other letters
expressing different classes of soils, gradually decreasing
in fertility as you recede from the first.  Now, as the
<em>expense</em> of <em>cultivating the least fertile soil is
as</em> great or <em>greater than that of the most
fertile field</em>, it necessarily follows, that <em>if an
equal quantity of corn, the produce of each
field, can be sold at the same price</em>, the profit
on cultivating the most fertile soil must be much greater
than that of cultivating the others”</p>
<p>&lt;namely the excess of price over the expenses or the
price of the capital advanced&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“and as this” &lt;i.e., the
profit&gt; “continues to decrease as the sterility
increases, it must at length <em>happen</em> that the
<em>expense of cultivating</em> some of the inferior classes
will <em>equal the value of the whole produce</em>.”
[James Anderson, <em>An Enquiry into the Nature of the Corn
Laws</em>, Edinburgh, 1777, pp. 45-48, quoted from
J. R. McCulloch, <em>The Literature of Political Economy</em>,
London, 1845, p. 69)</p>
<p>The last field pays no rent, (This is cited from
McCulloch, <em>The Literature of Political Economy</em>,
London, 1845.  Does McCulloch quote here from <em>An
Enquiry into the Nature of the Corn Lows</em> or from
<em>Recreations in Agriculture, Natural History, Arts
etc.</em>, London, 1799-1802?  This to be looked up at
the Museum.)</p>
<p>What Anderson calls “<em>value</em> of the whole
produce” is evidently nothing other than his
conception of the <em>market-price</em> at which the product
is sold, whether it grows on better or on worse land. 
With the more fertile types of land, this
“price” (value) leaves a greater or lesser
excess over the expenses.  This does not apply to the
last product.  Here the <em>average
price—i.e</em>., that formed by the costs of production
plus the average profit—coincides with the
market-price of the product.  Hence it does not yield
an excess profit, which alone can constitute rent. 
With Anderson, rent equals the excess of the
<em>market-price</em> of the product over its <em>average
price</em>.  (The theory of value as yet does not worry
Anderson at all.)  Thus if, as a result of the
particularly low fertility of the land, the <em>average
price</em> of the product of this land coincides with the
<em>market-price</em> of the product, then there is no excess
and therefore no fund for the formation of rent. 
Anderson does not say the last cultivated land <em>cannot
bear a rent</em>.  He only says that if it
“happens” that the expenses (the costs of
production plus the average profit) are so great that the
difference between the market-price of the product and its
average price disappears, then rent also disappears and that
this must be the case if one descends ever further down the
scale.  Anderson says expressly that a definite
<em>market-price equal</em> for equal quantities of produce
that have been produced under more favourable or less
favourable conditions of production, is the prerequisite for
this formation of rent.  He says that a surplus profit
or excess of profit from the better types of soil over that
from the worse, necessarily follows “<em>if an equal
quantity of corn</em>, the produce of <em>each</em> field, can
be sold at <em>the same price</em>”, i.e., if a general
market-price is presupposed.</p>
<p><span class="context">||514|</span> Anderson by no means
assumes, as might have appeared from the preceding passage,
that different <em>degrees of fertility</em> are merely the
product of nature.  On the contrary the</p>
<p class="quote">“… infinite diversity of
soils” arises partly from the fact that these
“soils […] may be so much altered from their
original state by the modes of culture they have been
formerly subjected to, by the manures etc.  (<em>An
Inquiry into the Causes that have hitherto Retarded the
Advancement of Agriculture in Europe</em>, Edinburgh, 1779,
p. 5).</p>
<p>On the one hand, the progress in the productivity of
labour in general makes it easier to bring land into
cultivation; on the other hand, cultivation increases the
diversity of soils, in that the original fertility of land A
which is cultivated and land B which is not, may have been
the same if we deduct from A’s fertility that part which,
though it is now inherent in it, had previously been added
<em>artificially</em>.  Thus cultivation itself increases
the diversity of natural fertility between cultivated and
waste lands.</p>
<p>Anderson says expressly that that land for whose produce
average price and market-price coincide, can pay <em>no</em>
rent:</p>
<p class="quote">“Where there are two fields, the
produce of which is nearly as above stated”, namely
the one yielding 12 bushels covering the costs, the other
20, “without requiring any <em>immediate outlay for
their improvement</em>, the farmer would […] pay even
more rent than” 6 bushels for instance for the latter
while [he would pay] none for the former.  If
“twelve bushels” are “just sufficient for
the expense of cultivating […] no rent whatever can
be afforded for <em>cultivated</em> land that yields only
twelve bushels” (James Anderson, <em>Essays Relating to
Agriculture and Rural Affairs</em>, Vol. III, Edinburgh,
1796, pp. 107-09).</p>
<p>Then he immediately goes on to say:</p>
<p class="quote">“Yet it cannot be expected that, if
the superior produce has been <em>immediately occasioned</em>
by his own outlay of capital and exertions of industry, he
<em>can</em> pay nearly the same <em>proportion</em> of it as
real: but after the land has been <em>for some time in a
permanent state of fertility to that degree</em>, though it
even <em>originally derived that fertility</em> from his own
industry, he will be content to pay such a proportion of
rent as is here stated…” (l.c., pp. 109-10).</p>
<p>Supposing therefore the produce of the best cultivated
land is 20 bushels per acre.  Of this, according to the
assumption, 12 bushels pay the expenses (advances plus
average profit).  Then it <em>can</em> pay 8 bushels as
rent.  Assume that the bushel is <em>5s</em>., then 8
bushels or 1 quarter are 40s, or £2 and 20 bushels are
£5 (2 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> quarters).  Of
these £5, 12 bushels or 60s, which is £3, is
expenses.  Then it pays a rent of £ 2 or 8
bushels.  If the rate of profit is 10 per cent then of
the £ 3 expenses, the outlay is 54
<sup class="ratio">6</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>s. and the profit is 5
<sup class="ratio">5</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>s. (54<sup class="ratio">6</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> :
5<sup class="ratio">5</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> = 100 : 10).  Now
supposing, the farmer had to carry out various improvements
on waste land, which is just as fertile as that yielding 20
bushels had been <em>originally</em>, in order to bring it
into such a state of cultivation that would correspond to
the general state of agriculture.  Apart from the
outlay of 54 <sup class="ratio">6</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>s.  or, if we reckon
the profit in with the expenses, apart from 60s., this may
involve a further outlay of 36 <sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>;
then 10 per cent on this would be 3
<sup class="ratio">7</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>, and if the farmer always sold 20
bushels at 5s, he could pay a rent only after 10 years, only
after the reproduction of his capital.  From then on
the artificially created fertility of the land would he
reckoned as original and would fall to the landlord.</p>
<p>Although the newly cultivated land is as fertile as the
best cultivated land was originally, the market-price and
the average price for its product do nevertheless coincide
now, because it contains an item of costs which is extinct
in the best land, whose artificially created fertility and
whose natural fertility coincide to a certain extent. 
But with the newly cultivated land, that part of fertility
which is created artificially, by the application of
capital, is still entirely distinct from the natural
fertility of the land.  The newly cultivated land can
therefore pay <em>no rent</em> although its original fertility
may be the same as that of the best cultivated land. 
After ten years, however, it could pay not only rent, but as
much rent as the best type which was <em>cultivated</em>
earlier.  Thus Anderson comprehends both phenomena:</p>
<p>1.  That the differential rent of the landlords is
partly the result of the fertility which the farmer has
given the land artificially.</p>
<p>2.  That after a certain lapse of time, this
artificial fertility appears as the original productivity of
the soil itself, in that the soil itself has been
transformed and the process by which this transformation has
been accomplished, has disappeared and is no longer
visible.</p>
<p><span class="context">||515|</span> If to-day I build a
cotton mill for £100,000, I get a more efficient mill
than my predecessor who set one up ten years ago.  I do
not pay for the difference between productivity in
machine-building, building in general etc. of to-day and of
ten years ago; on the contrary.  It enables me to pay
<em>less</em> for a mill of the same efficiency or only <em>the
same</em> for a mill d higher efficiency.  In
agriculture it is different.  The difference between
the original fertilities of the soils is magnified by that
part of the so-called natural fertility of the soil which,
in fact, has been once <em>produced</em> by men, but has now
become incorporated in the soil and is no longer to be
distinguished from its original fertility.  Owing to
the development of the productive power of labour in
general, it costs less to raise uncultivated soil of the
same original fertility to the <em>improved</em> level of
fertility, than it cost to bring the original fertility of
the cultivated soil to the apparently original fertility it
now has, but some expenditure is still required to bring
that equalisation about.  The average price of the new
product is consequently higher than that of the old, the
difference between market-price and average price is thus
smaller and may disappear completely.  But supposing,
in the above case, the newly cultivated soil is so fertile,
that after the additional expense of 40s.  (including
profit) it yields 28 bushels instead of 20.  In this
case the farmer could pay a rent of 8bushels or
£2.  And why?  Because the newly cultivated
soil yields 8 bushels more than the old, so that despite the
higher average price, with the same market-price, it yields
just as much in excess of the price.  If it had
involved no extra expense, its fertility would be double
that of the old land.  With this expense it is the same
as that of the old land.</p>

<h3>[10.  The Untenability of the Rodbertian Critique
Rodbertus’s of Ricardo’s Theory of Rent.  Lack of
Understanding of the Peculiarities of Capitalist
Agriculture]</h3>
<p><a name="vol31-p376"> </a></p>
<h5>Now back to Rodbertus, definitively and for the last time.</h5>
<p class="quote">“It” (Rodbertus’s theory of
rent) “explains all phenomena of wages and rent
etc.…by a <em>division of the labour product</em>,
which necessarily occurs if two prerequisites, adequate
productivity of labour and property in land and capital, are
given.  It explains that the adequate productivity of
labour alone constitutes the <em>economic possibility of such
a division</em>, in that this productivity gives to the value
of the product so much actual content that in addition other
people who do not work, can also live from it.  And it
explains that landed property and capital property alone
constitute the <em>legal reality of such a division</em>, in
that it forces the workers to <em>share their product</em>
with the non-working proprietors of land and capital and,
what is more, in such a proportion that they, the workers,
only get so much of it as to enable them to
live.” (Rodbertus [<em>Sociale Briefe on von
Kirchmann, Dritter Brief</em>, Berlin, 1851],
pp. 156-57.)</p>
<p>Adam Smith sets forth this problem in two ways. 
[The first concept:] <em>Division of the product of
labour</em> where this is regarded as given and he is in fact
concerned with the <em>distribution of use-value</em>. 
This is also Herr Rodbertus’s conception.  It is also
to he found with Ricardo who is all the more to be
reproached on this account because he does not merely
confine himself to general phrases but seriously tries to
<em>determine the value by labour-time</em>.  This
conception is more or less, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>,
applicable to all modes of production where the workers and
the owners of the objective conditions of labour form
different classes.</p>
<p>Smith’s second conception, on the other hand, is
characteristic of the capitalist mode of production, Hence
it alone is a theoretically fruitful formula.  For
Smith here conceives of profit and rent as springing from
the <em>surplus labour</em> which the worker adds to the
subject of labour, apart from that portion of labour by
which he only reproduces his own wage.  This is the
only correct standpoint where production rests solely on
exchange-value.  This concept comprises the process of
development, whereas the first concept presupposes that
<em>labour-time</em> is constant.</p>
<p>With Ricardo the one-sidedness arises also from the fact
that in general he wants to show that the various economic
categories or relationships <em>do not contradict the theory
of value</em>, instead of on the contrary, <em>developing</em>
them together with their apparent contradictions out of this
basis or presenting the development of this basis
itself.</p>
<p class="quote"><span class="context">||516|</span>
“You<a href="#-ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[t]</a> know,
that <em>all economists</em>, already from Adam Smith onwards,
<em>split up the value of the product into wages, ground-rent
and capital gain</em> and that therefore the idea of basing
the incomes of the different classes and particularly also
rent on a <em>division of the product</em> is nothing
new.”  (Certainly not!)  “Only the
economists immediately go astray.  All of
them—not even excepting the Ricardian
School—<em>first of all</em> commit the error of not
regarding the <em>whole</em> product, the <em>entire</em>
wealth, the <em>total national product</em> as the unit in
which the workers, the landowners and the capitalists
participate.  On the contrary they regard the
<em>division of the raw product</em> as a <em>particular
division</em> in which <em>three participants</em> share, and
the division of the manufactured product again as a
particular division in which <em>only two</em> participants
share.  So these systems consider that the mere raw
product and the mere manufactured product, each in itself,
is a special kind of wealth which constitutes income”
(l.c., p. 162).</p>
<p>First of all, by breaking down the “<em>whole</em>
value of the product into wages, ground-rent and capital
gain” [p. 162] and thus forgetting about constant
capital which also forms a part of value, Adam Smith has in
fact led “<em>astray</em>” <em>all</em> the later
economists, including Ricardo and including Herr
Rodbertus.  As my exposition has shown, the lack of
this differentiation made any scientific presentation quite
impossible.  In this respect the Physiocrats were
further advanced.  Their “<em>avances primitives
et annuelles</em>”<a href="#-ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[u]</a> are defined as a part of the value
of the annual product or as a part of the annual product
itself, which is not resolved into wages, profit or rent,
either for the nation or for the individual.  According
to the Physiocrats, the raw material of the agriculturists
replaces the advances of the sterile class (the
transformation of this raw material into machines of course
devolves on the sterile class), while, on the other hand,
the agriculturists replace a part of their own advances
(seeds, cattle for breeding and draught animals, fertiliser
etc.) from their product and get a part, machinery
etc. replaced by the sterile class in exchange for raw
material.</p>
<p>Secondly Herr Rodbertus errs in that he identifies
<em>division of value</em> with <em>division of
product</em>.  The “<em>wealth which constitutes
income</em>” has nothing directly to do with this
<em>division of the value</em> of the product.  That the
portions of value which accrue, for instance, to the
producers of yarn, and which are represented in certain
quantities of gold, <em>exist</em> as agricultural and
manufactured products of all kinds is equally well known to
the economists as to Rodbertus.  This is <em>taken for
granted</em> because <em>commodities</em> are produced and not
products for the immediate consumption of the producers
themselves.  Since the value which becomes available
for distribution, i.e., the part of value which forms
revenue, is created within each individual sphere of
production, independently of the others—although, on
account of the division of labour, it presupposes the
others—Rodbertus takes a step backward and creates
confusion, by not examining this creation of value on its
own, but confusing it right from the start by asking what
share of the available total product of the nation these
component parts secure for their owners.  With
Rodbertus, division of the <em>value of the product</em>
immediately becomes <em>division of use-values</em>. 
Because he foists this confusion upon the other economists,
there arises the need for his corrective, i.e., the
consideration of manufactured and raw products <em>en
bloc</em>—a mode of procedure which is irrelevant to
the creation of value, and hence wrong if it is to explain
the latter.</p>
<p>The only participants in the <em>value</em> of the
manufactured product.  In 50 far as it comprises
revenue and in so far as the manufacturer does not pay a
rent, he it for land on which the buildings stand or for
waterfalls, etc., are the <em>capitalist and the
wage-labourer</em>.  The <em>value of the agricultural
produce</em> is generally divided between three.  This
Herr Rodbertus also admits.  The manner in which he
explains this phenomenon does not in any way alter this
fact.  It is entirely in accord with the standpoint of
capitalist production that the other economists, especially
Ricardo, start from a <em>division into two</em>, between
capitalist and wage-labourer, and only bring in the
landowner who draws rent at a later stage, as a special
excrescence.  Capitalist production is based on the
antithesis of two factors <span class="context">||517|</span> , materialised labour and
living labour.  Capitalist and wage-labourer are the
sole functionaries and factors of production whose
relationship and confrontation arise from the nature of the
capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>The circumstances under which the capitalist has in turn
to share a part of the surplus-labour or surplus-value which
he has captured, with a third, non-working person, are only
of secondary importance.  It is also a fact of
production, that, after the part of the value which is equal
to constant capital is deducted, the <em>entire surplus-value
passes straight from the hands of the worker to those of the
capitalist</em>, with the exception of that part of the value
of the product which is paid out as wages.  The
capitalist confronts the worker as the <em>direct</em> owner
of the entire surplus-value, in whatever manner he may later
he sharing it with the money-lending capitalist, landowner
etc.  As James Mill observes, production could
therefore continue undisturbed if the landed proprietor
disappeared and the state took his place.  He—the
private landowner—is not a necessary agent for
capitalist production, although it does require that the
land should belong to someone, so long as it is not the
worker, but for instance, the state.  Far from being an
error on the part of Ricardo etc., this reduction of the
classes participating directly in production, hence also in
the value produced and then in the products in which this
value is embodied, to <em>capitalists and wage-labourers</em>,
and the <em>exclusion of the landowners</em> (who only enter
<em>post festum</em>, as a result of conditions of ownership
of natural forces that have <em>not grown out</em> of the
capitalist node of production but have been <em>passed on</em>
to it) is rooted in the nature of the <em>capitalist mode of
production—as</em> distinct from the feudal, ancient
etc.  This reduction is an adequate theoretical
expression of the capitalist mode of production, and reveals
its <em>differentia specifica</em>.  Herr Rodbertus is
still too much of an old Prussian “landed
proprietor”, to understand this.  Furthermore, it
can only he grasped and become self-evident when the
capitalist has seized agriculture, and everywhere, as is
generally the case in England, has taken charge of
agriculture just as he has of industry, and has
<em>excluded</em> the <em>landowner</em> from any direct
participation in the production process.  What
Rodbertus regards as a “deviation”, is,
therefore, the right path, which however he does not
understand because he is still engrossed in views that
originated from the pre-capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p class="quote">“He too” (Ricardo) “does
not divide the <em>finished</em> product among the parties
concerned, but, like the other economists, regards the
agricultural product as well as the manufactured
product—as a separate product, which has to be
divided” (l.c., p. 167).</p>
<p>Not the product, Herr Rodbertus, but the <em>value</em> of
the product, and this is quite correct.  Your
“finished” product and its division have
absolutely nothing to do with this division of value.</p>
<p class="quote">“He” (Ricardo) “regards
capital property as given and <em>that even earlier</em> than
landed property…  Thus he does not begin with
the reasons for but with the <em>fact</em> of the division of
the product, and his entire theory is limited to the causes
which determine and modify the <em>proportions of the
shares</em>…  The division of the product purely into
<em>wages</em> and <em>capital gain</em> is for him the
<em>original one</em> and originally also the only one”
(l.c., p.167).</p>
<p>This you fail to understand again, Herr Rodbertus. 
From the standpoint of capitalist production, <em>capital
property</em> does in fact appear as the
“original” because capitalist production is
based on this sort of property and it is a factor of and
fulfils a function in <em>capitalist production;</em> this
does not hold good of landed property.  The latter
<em>appears</em> as derivative, because modern landed property
is in fact <em>feudal</em> property, but transformed by the
action of capital upon it; in its form as modern landed
property it is therefore <em>derived from</em>, and the result
of capitalist production.  That Ricardo considers the
position as it is and appears in modern society to be also
the <em>historically</em> original situation (whereas you,
instead of keeping to the modern form, cannot rid yourself
of your memories of landownership) is a delusion from which
the bourgeois economists suffer in respect of all bourgeois
economic laws.  They appear to them as “natural
laws” and hence also as historically
“primary”.</p>
<p><span class="context">||518|</span> But Herr Rodbertus
could already see from the very first sentence of his
preface, that Ricardo, where it is not a question of the
<em>value</em> of the product, but of <em>the product
itself</em>, permits the <em>whole</em> of the
‘finished” product to he shared out.</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>produce of the
earth</em>—all that is derived from its surface by the
united application of labour, machinery, and capital, is
divided among three classes of the community; namely, the
proprietor of the land, the owner of the stack or capital
necessary for its cultivation, and the labourers by whose
industry it is cultivated.” (David Ricardo, <em>The
Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</em>, London,
1821, third edition, Preface, p. V.)</p>
<p>He continues forthwith:</p>
<p class="quote">“But in different stages of society,
the proportions of the <em>whole produce</em> of the earth
which will be allotted to each of these classes, under the
names of rent, profit, and wages, will be essentially
different” (l.c., p.  V).</p>
<p>He is concerned here with the distribution of the
‘<em>whole produce</em>”, not the manufactured
product or the raw product.  If this whole
produce” is taken as given, these shares in the
“whole produce” are solely determined within
each sphere of production by the share which each
shareholder has in the ‘<em>value</em>” of his own
product.  This “value” is convertible into
and can he expressed in a certain proportional part of the
“<em>whole produce</em>”.  Ricardo only errs
here, following Adam Smith, in that he forgets that
“the whole produce” is not divided into rent,
profit and wages, but that part of it “will be
allotted” in the shape of capital to one or some of
these three classes.</p>
<p class="quote">“You might want to assert, that, just
as <em>originally</em> the law of equal capital gains would
have had to depress raw product prices so far that
ground-rent would have to disappear only to be re-created as
a result of a rise in prices due to the difference between
the yield of more fertile and less fertile land—
<em>so, to-day</em> the advantages of drawing rent besides the
usual capital gain, would induce the capitalist to spend
capital on flew cultivation and improvements until, due to
the flooding of markets brought forth by this, prices would
fall sufficiently in order to make rents on the least
favourable capital investments disappear again.  <em>In
other words, this would be to assert that, so far as the raw
product is concerned, the law of the equalisation of capital
gains invalidates the other law, that the value of the
products is governed by labour costs</em>, while it is just
<em>Ricardo</em>, who, in the first chapter of his work, uses
the former to prove the latter” (Rodbertus, l.c.,
p. 174).</p>
<p>Indeed, Herr Rodbertus!  The law of the
<em>equalisation of capital gains</em>” does not
invalidate the law that the “<em>value</em>” of
the products is governed by “labour
costs”.  But it does invalidate Ricardo’s
assumption that the <em>average price</em> of the products
equals their “<em>value</em>”.  But there
again, it is not the “raw product” whose value
is reduced to the average price, but <em>the other way
about</em>.  Due to landed property, the ‘raw
product” is distinguished by the privilege that its
value is <em>not</em> reduced to the average price.  If,
indeed, its <em>value</em> did decrease, which would be
possible despite your “value of the material”,
to the level of the average price of the commodities, then
rent would disappear.  The types of land which possibly
pay no rent to-day, pay none, because the
<em>market-price</em> of raw products is for them equal to
their own <em>average price</em>, and because the competition
of more fertile types of land <em>deprives</em> them of the
privilege of selling their product at <em>its</em>
‘value”.</p>
<p class="quote">“Could it be true that <em>before</em>
any cultivation takes place at all capitalists already exist
who receive a profit and invest their capital according to
the law of profit equalisation?’ (How very
silly!)  “… I admit, that if to-day an
expedition from the civilised countries set out to a
<span class="context">||519|</span> new, uncultivated land,
an expedition in which the wealthier participants were
equipped with supplies and tools—capital—from an
old established culture and the poorer ones came along with
a view to winning a high wage in the service of the former,
then the capitalists would regard as their gain that which
remains to them over and above the wages of the workers for
they bring with them from their mother country things and
ideas which have long been in existence there” (l.c.,
pp. 174-75).</p>
<p>Well, here you have it, Herr Rodbertus.  Ricardo’s
whole conception is only appropriate to the presupposition
that the capitalist mode of production is the predominant
one.  How he expresses this <em>presupposition</em>,
whether he commits a historical <em>hysteron proteron</em> is
irrelevant to the theory.  The <em>presupposition</em>
must he made, and it is therefore impossible to introduce,
as yon are doing, the peasant, who does not understand
capitalist book-keeping and hence does not reckon seeds
etc., as part of the capital advanced!  The
“absurdity” is introduced not by Ricardo but by
Rodbertus, who assumes that capitalists and workers exist
“<em>before</em> cultivation of the land” (l.c.,
p. 176).</p>
<p class="quote">“According to the Ricardian concept,
cultivation of the land is supposed to begin … only when
… capital has been created in a society and capital
gain is known and paid” (l.c., p. 178).</p>
<p>What utter nonsense!  Only when a capitalist has
squeezed himself as farmer between the husbandman and the
landed proprietor—he it that the old tenant has
swindled his way into becoming a capitalist farmer, or that
an industrialist has invested his capital in agriculture
rather than in manufacture—only then he-gins, by no
means “the cultivation of the land”, but
‘capitalist” land cultivation which is very
different, both in form and content from the previous forms
of cultivation.</p>
<p class="quote">“In every country the greater part of
the land is already owned by someone long before it is
cultivated; and certainly, long before a rate of capital
profit has been established in industry” (l.c.,
p. 179).</p>
<p>To comprehend Ricardo’s conception Rodbertus would have
to be an Englishman instead of a Pomeranian landowner and
would have to understand the history of the enclosure of
commons and waste land.  Rodbertus cites America. 
There the state sells the land</p>
<p class="quote">“in lots, first to the cultivators at
a low price, it is true, but one which must <em>at all
events</em> already represent a rent” (l.c., pp.
179-80).</p>
<p>By no means.  This price does not constitute a
ground-rent, any more than, say, a general trade tax
constitutes a <em>trade rent</em> or in fact any tax
constitutes a “rent”.</p>
<p class="quote">“With regard to the cause of the rise
under point b” (the increase in population or the
increase in the <em>quantity of labour employed</em>) “I
maintain, however, that rent has precedence over capital
gain.  The latter can <em>never</em> rise because, as a
result of the increased value of the national
product—if <em>productivity remains the same</em> but
productive power increases (increased population)—more
capital gain accrues to the nation, for this <em>greater</em>
capital gain always accrues to a <em>capital</em> which is
<em>greater</em> in the same <em>proportion</em>, the rate of
profit therefore remains the same” (l.c.,
pp. 184-85).</p>
<p>This is wrong.  The quantity of unpaid
surplus-labour rises, for instance, if 3, 4 5 hours surplus
labour-time are worked instead of 2 hours.  The volume
of capital advanced does not grow [to the same extent] as
the volume of this <em>unpaid</em> surplus-labour, firstly,
because this further excess of surplus-labour is <em>not</em>
paid for and so does not occasion a capital outlay;
secondly, because the capital outlay for fixed capital does
not grow in the same proportion as its utilisation in this
instance.  No more spindles etc. <em>are</em>
required.  True, they are used tip more quickly but not
in the same proportion in which their use increases. 
Thus, given the same productivity, profit grows here,
because not only the surplus-value grows, but also the
<em>rate of surplus-value</em>.  In agriculture this is
impracticable because of the natural conditions.  On
the other hand, <em>productivity</em> is easily altered with
the increased outlay of capital.  Although an
absolutely large amount of capital is laid out, it is
relatively not so big, due to economies in the conditions of
production, quite apart from the division of labour and
machinery.  Thus the <em>rate of profit</em> could grow
even if the surplus-value (not only <em>its rate</em>)
remained the same.</p>
<p><span class="context">||520|</span> Rodbertus is
positively wrong, and typically the Pomeranian landowner
when he says:</p>
<p class="quote">“It is possible that in the course of
these thirty years” (1800-1830) “<em>more</em>
properties came into being through the parcelling out of
land or even <em>through the cultivation of new land</em> and
the increased rent was thus also divided among more
landowners, but it was <em>not distributed over more acres in
1830 than</em> in <em>1800</em>.  Previously <em>the older
properties</em> comprised the whole of the acreage of those
newly separated or newly cultivated properties and the lower
rent of 1800 was also <em>calculated</em> on them, and this
influenced the level of English rent in general at that time
just as much as the higher rent in 1830” (l.c.,
p. 186).</p>
<p>Worthy Pomeranian!  Why do you always transfer your
Prussian situation to England in a disparaging manner? 
The English-man does not reckon that, if, as was the case
(this to be looked up), three to four million acres were
‘enclosed” between 1800 and 1830, the rent on
these four million acres was calculated before 1830 as well
and also in 1800.  Rather they were waste land or
commons which bore no rent and did not belong to
anybody.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with Ricardo if Rodbertus, like
Carey (but in a different way), seeks to prove to Ricardo
that for physical and other reasons, the ‘most
fertile” hand is usually not the first to he
cultivated.  The “most fertile” land is
always the “most fertile” under the existing
conditions of production.</p>
<p>A very large number of the objections which Rodbertus
raises against Ricardo arise from the naive manner in which
he identifies the “Pomeranian” conditions of
production with the “English”.  Ricardo
presupposes capitalist production to which, where it is in
fact carried out, as in England corresponds the separation
of the farming capitalist from the landlord.  Rodbertus
introduces circumstances which are in themselves alien to
the capitalist node of production, which has merely been
built upon them.  For instance, what Herr Rodbertus
says about the position of economic centres in economic
complexes applies perfectly to Pomerania but not to England,
where the capitalist node of production has become
increasingly pre-eminent since the last third of the 16th
century, where it has assimilated all the conditions and in
different periods has progressively sent historical
preconditions, villages, buildings and people, to the devil,
in order to secure the “most productive”
investment for capital.</p>
<p>What Rodbertus says about “capital
investment” is equally wrong.</p>
<p class="quote">“Ricardo limits ground-rent to that
which the landowner is paid for the use of he <em>original,
natural and indestructible qualities of the land</em>. 
He thus wants to ensure that everything which would have to
be ascribed to capital in be land which is already being
cultivated is deducted from rent.  But it is clear that
out of the yield from a piece of land he must never allot
more to capital than the <em>full interest customary in a
country</em>.  For otherwise he would have to assume
that there are two different rates of gain in the economic
development of a country one agricultural, which is greater
than that prevailing in manufacture, and this latter. 
This assumption would overthrow his very system, which is
based on the equality of the rate of gain” (l.c., pp.
215-16)</p>
<p>Again the notion of the Pomeranian landowner who gets
money on tick in order to improve his property and who for
theoretical and practical reasons, only wants to pay the
money-lender the “customary interest”.  But
in England things are different.  It is the farmer, the
farming-capitalist, who lays out capital in order to improve
the land.  From this capital, just as from that which
he hays out directly in production, he does not demand the
customary interest but the <em>customary profit</em>.  He
does not tend the landowner any capital on which the latter
is to pay the “customary” interest.  He may
borrow capital himself, or else lie uses his own surplus
capital so that it yields him the “customary”
industrial profit, at least double the customary
interest.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Ricardo knows what Anderson already knew
and, into the bargain, expressly says that <span class="context">||521|</span> the productivity of the land
thus engendered by capital, later coincides with its
“natural” productivity, hence swells the
rent.  Rodbertus knows nothing of all this and
therefore babbles away at random.</p>
<p>I have already given a correct explanation of modern
landed property:</p>
<p class="quote">“Rent, in the Ricardian sense, is
property in land in its bourgeois state; that is, feudal
property which has become subject to the conditions of
bourgeois production.” (<em>Misère de la
Philosophie</em>, Paris, 1847 p. 156.)</p>
<p>Similarly I have already correctly observed:</p>
<p class="quote">“Ricardo, after postulating bourgeois
production as necessary for determining rent, applies the
conception of rent, nevertheless, to the landed properly of
all ages and all countries.  This is an error common to
all the economists who represent the bourgeois relations of
production as eternal categories” (l.c., p. 160)</p>
<p>I also pointed out correctly that ‘land as
capital” could be increased like all other
capitals:</p>
<p class="quote">“Land as capital can be
<em>increased</em> just as much as all the other instruments
of production.  Nothing is added to its matter, to use
M. Proudhon’s language, but <em>the lands which serve
as instruments of production are multiplied</em>. 
The very fact of applying further outlays of capital to land
already transformed into means of production increases land
as capital without adding anything to land as matter, that
is, to the extent of he land” (l.c., p. 165)</p>
<p>The difference between manufacture and agriculture which
I pointed out at that time still remains correct:</p>
<p class="quote">“In the first place, one cannot, as
in manufacturing industry, <em>multiply at will the
instruments of production possessing the same degree at
productivity</em>, that is, plots of land with the same
degree of fertility.  Them as population increases,
land of an inferior quality begins to be exploited, or mew
outlays of capital, proportionately less productive than
before, are made upon the same plot of land” (l.c.,
p. 157)</p>
<p><em>Rodbertus</em> says:</p>
<p class="quote">“But I must draw attention to yet
another circumstance which, admittedly, much more gradually,
but also far more generally, turns worse agricultural
machines into better ones.  This is the <em>continued
management</em> of a piece of land merely in accordance with
a rational system, without making any special capital
investment.” ([<em>Sociale Briefe on von Kirchmann,
Dritter Brief</em>], p. 222.)</p>
<p>Anderson already said cultivation improves the
land. [Rodbertus continues.]</p>
<p class="quote">“You would have to prove that the
working population engaged in agriculture had, in the course
of time, increased to a greater degree than the production
of food or even just compared with the rest of the
population of a country.  Only this could irrefutably
show that increasing agricultural production also demands
that progressively more labour is expended upon it. 
But it is just here that statistics contradict you”
(l.c., p.  274).  “Indeed, you will find that,
[pretty well] as a rule, the denser the population of a
country, the smaller will be the proportion of people
engaged in agriculture… The same phenomenon can be
observed when the population of a country increases: that
section which is <em>not</em> engaged in agriculture will
almost everywhere increase to a greater degree” (l.c.,
p. 275).</p>
<p>But this is partly because more arable land is turned
over to cattle and sheep grazing, partly because with the
higher stage of production—large-scale
agriculture—labour becomes more productive. 
<em>But also</em>, and this is a circumstance which Herr
Rodbertus overlooks entirely, because a greater part of the
<em>non-agricultural population</em> assist in agriculture,
supplying constant capital—which grows with the
advance in cultivation—such as mineral fertilisers,
seeds from other countries, machinery of every sort.</p>
<p>According in Herr Rodbertus (l.c., p. 78):</p>
<p class="quote">“At present the agriculturist”
(in Pomerania) “does not” (regard) the
feeding-stuffs for his draught animals as capital, if he has
grown these in his own establishment…”</p>
<p><span class="context">||522|</span> “Capital in
itself, or from an economic point of view, is a product
which continues to be used for production…  But
in respect of a particular gain which it is to yield, or
from the point of view of <em>to-day’s entrepreneurs</em>, it
must appear as an ‘outlay’ in order to be
capital” (l.c., p. 77).</p>
<p>This concept of “outlay” however does not, as
Rodbertus thinks, require that it is bought as a
commodity.  If instead of being <em>sold</em> as a
commodity, a part of the product re-enters production, it
does so as a <em>commodity</em>.  It has previously been
estimated as “money”, this is easily done, since
simultaneously all these “outlays’, in
agriculture too, are available on the market as
“commodities”: cattle, feeding-stuffs,
fertilisers, corn for sowing, seeds of all kinds.  But
it seems that in “Pomerania” this is not
reckoned as “outlay”.</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>value</em> of the particular
results of these different sorts of work” (manufacture
and primary production) “is not the income itself
which accrues to their owner, but only the measure for its
conversion into money.  This particular income itself
is a part of the social income, which is only produced by
the combined labour in agriculture and manufacture, and its
<em>elements</em> too are thus only produced by this combined
effort” (l.c., p. 36).</p>
<p>This is quite irrelevant.  The realisation of this
<em>value</em> can only be its realisation in use-value. 
But we are not concerned with that.  Furthermore, the
<em>necessary wage</em> already implies how much value in the
shape of agricultural and industrial products is contained
in the means of subsistence the worker requires.</p>
