<h1>[Chapter XIV] 
Adam Smith’s Theory of Rent<a name="s1"> </a></h1>
<h3>[1.  Contradictions in Smith’s Formulation of the
Problem of Rent]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||619|</span> At this stage we
shall not examine Smith’s interesting account of how the
rent of the principal vegetable food dominates all other
strictly agricultural rents (stock raising, timber,
industrial crops), because each of these branches of
production can easily be transformed into one of the
others.  Adam Smith excludes rice from this,
wherever it is the principal vegetable food, since rice
fields (or bogs) are not convertible into grass land, wheat
lands, etc. and vice versa.</p>
<p>[In Chapter XI, Book I] Adam Smith correctly defines
<em>rent</em> as “the price paid for <em>the use of
land</em>” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 162; Garnier,] t, I,
p. 299), the term land is intended to mean every power of
nature as such, therefore also water, etc.</p>
<p>In contrast to Rodbertus’s peculiar notion, Smith, from
the outset, enumerates the items of agricultural
capital:</p>
<p class="quote">“The stock from which he furnishes
the seed” (the raw material), “pays the labour,
and purchases and maintains the cattle and other
<em>instruments</em> of husbandry” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
p. 163; Garnier,] l.c.).</p>
<p>Now what is this price paid for the use of land?</p>
<p class="quote">“Whatever part of the produce
or… of its price, is over and above this shame”
(which pays for the capital advanced “together with
the ordinary profits”), “he” (the
<em>landlord</em>) “naturally endeavours to reserve to
himself as the <em>rent</em> of his land” ([O.U.P.,
Vol. I, p. 163; Garnier,] l.c., p. 300).</p>
<p class="quote">This <em>excess</em> may “he considered as the
<em>natural rent</em> of land” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 163;
Garnier,] l.c., p. 300).</p>
<p>Smith refuses to confuse rent with the interest on
capital invested in the land.</p>
<p class="quote">“The landlord demands a rent even for
unimproved land” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 163; Garnier,]
l.c., pp. 300-01).</p>
<p>and, he adds, even this second form of rent [i.e., the
rent on the improved land] is peculiar in that the interest
from the capital used on improvement is interest on a
capital which has not been laid out by the landlord, but by
the farmer.</p>
<p class="quote">“He” (the landlord)
“sometimes demands rent for what is altogether
incapable of human improvements” ([O.U.P., Vol.
I, pp. 163-64; Garnier,] l.c., p. 301).</p>
<p>Smith stresses very strongly, that it is <em>landed
property</em>, the <em>landlord</em>, who as <em>landlord</em>
“demands the rent”.  [Regarded] as a mere
effluence of <em>landed property</em>, rent is <em>monopoly
price</em>, this is perfectly correct, since it is only the
intervention of landed property which enables the product to
be sold for more than the cost-price, to be sold at its
value.</p>
<p class="quote">“The rent of land considered as the
price paid for the use of the land, is naturally a monopoly
price” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 164; Garnier,] l.c.,
p. 302).</p>
<p>It is in fact a price which is only enforced through the
monopoly of landed property, and as a monopoly price, it
differs from the price of the industrial product.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of capital—and capital dominates
production—the <em>cost-price</em> only requires that the
product should pay the average profit in addition to the
capital advanced.  In this case, the product, be it
product of the land or any other product, <em>can “be
brought to market</em>”.</p>
<p class="quote">“If the ordinary price is more than
this, the <em>surplus</em> part of it will naturally go to the
rent of the land.  If it is not more, though the
commodity <em>may</em> be brought to market, it can afford no
rent to the landlord.  Whether the price is, or is not
more, depends upon the demand” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
p. 164; Garnier,] l.c., p. 303).</p>
<p>Why does rent enter into price differently from wages and
profit?  That is the question.  Originally, Smith
had resolved value correctly, into wages, profits and rents
(apart from constant capital).  But almost at once he
takes the opposite course and identifies value with natural
price (the average price determined by competition or the
cost-price of the commodities) and builds up the latter from
wages, profit and rent.</p>
<p class="quote">“These three parts seem either
immediately or ultimately to make up the whole price”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 55; Garnier,] l. I, ch. VI,
p. 101).</p>
<p class="quote">“In the most improved societies,
however, there are always a few commodities <em>of which the
price r e s o l v e s  i t s e l f into two parts
only</em>, the <em>wages of labour and the profits of
stock;</em> and a still smaller number, in which <em>it
consists altogether in the wages of labour</em>.  In the
price of sea-fish, for example, one part pays the labour of
the fishermen, and the other the profits of the capital
employed in the fishery.  <em>Rent</em> very seldom makes
any part <span class="context">||620|</span> of
it…  In some parts of Scotland, a few poor
people make a trade of gathering, along the sea-shore, those
little variegated stones commonly known by the name of
<em>Scotch pebbles</em>.  The price which is paid to them
by the <em>stone-cutter</em>, is altogether the <em>wages of
their labour; neither rent nor profit makes any part of
it</em>.</p>
<p class="quote">“But the <em>whole price of any
commodity</em> must still finally resolve itself <em>into some
one or other or all of those three parts</em>”
([O.U.P., Vol. I. pp. 56-57; Garnier,] l. I, ch. VI,
pp. 103-04).</p>
<p>In these passages, the resolving of value into wages,
etc. and the compounding of price from wages, etc., are
jumbled together (this applies to Chapter VI in general
which deals with “<em>the Component Parts of the Price
of Commodities</em>”).  (Natural price and
market-price are for the first time discussed in Chapter
VII).</p>
<p><em>Book I, Chapters I, II, III</em> deal with the
“division of labour”, <em>Chapter IV</em> with
money.  In these, as in the following chapters,
<em>value</em> is determined in passing.  <em>Chapter
V</em> deals with the <em>real and nominal price</em> of
commodities, with the transformation of <em>value into
price;</em> “the Component Parts of the Price of
Commodities” are considered in <em>Chapter VI;</em> the
<em>natural and market-price</em> in <em>Chapter VII</em>. 
Then <em>Chapter VIII</em> deals with the wages of labour,
<em>Chapter IX</em> with the profits of stock; <em>Chapter
X</em> with the <em>Wages and Profit in the different
Employments of Labour and Stock;</em> finally, <em>Chapter
XI</em> with the <em>Rent of Land</em>.</p>
<p>But in this connection we want first to draw attention to
the following: According to the passages cited above, there
are commodities whose <em>price</em> consists solely of wages,
others, whose price consists only of wages and profit, and
finally a third group of commodities, whose price consists
of wages, profit and rent.  Hence:</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>whole price of any
commodity</em> must still … resolve itself <em>into
some one or other</em> or <em>all of those three
parts</em>.”</p>
<p>According to this, there would be no grounds for saying
that rent enters into price in a different manner from
profit and wages, but one could say that rent and profit
enter into price in a different way from wages, since the
latter always enters [into price], the former not
always.  <em>Whence, then, the difference?</em></p>
<p>Moreover, Smith should have investigated, whether it is
possible that the few commodities which only <em>comprise
wages</em>, are sold at <em>their value</em>, or whether the
poor people who gather the Scotch pebbles are not in fact
the wage-labourers of the <em>stone-cutters</em>, who pay them
only the usual wages for the commodity, in other words for a
<em>whole working-day, which apparently belongs to them</em>,
these people receive only as much as a worker in other
trades, where <em>part of the working-day</em> forms profit
and belongs not to him but to the capitalist.  Smith
should have either affirmed this or else asserted that in
this case the profit only <em>seems</em> to be confounded with
wages.  He says himself:</p>
<p class="quote">“When those three different sorts of
revenue belong to different persons, they are readily
distinguished; but when they belong to the same, they are
sometimes confounded with one another, at least in common
language” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 58; Garnier,] l. I,
ch. VI, p. 106).</p>
<p>He nevertheless works out this problem in the
following manner:</p>
<p>If an independent labourer (like those poor people of
Scotland) uses only labour (without recourse to capital),
if, altogether, he only employs his labour and the elements,
then the price resolves itself solely into wages.  If
he employs a small capital as well, then the same individual
receives wages and profit.  If, finally, he employs his
labour, his capital and his landed property, then he unites
in his person the characters of landowner, farmer and
worker.</p>
<p>{The whole absurdity of Smith’s approach comes to light
in one of the final passages of Chapter VI, Book I:</p>
<p class="quote">“As in a civilised country there are
but few commodities of which the <em>exchangeable value</em>
arises <em>from labour only</em>” (here labour is
identified with <em>wages) “rent</em> and <em>profit</em>
contributing largely to that of the far greater part of
them, so the <em>annual produce of its labour</em>”
(here, after all, the commodities are the <em>produce</em> of
<em>labour</em>, although the whole value of this produce does
not arise from labour only) “will always be sufficient
<em>to purchase</em> or <em>command a much greater quantity of
labour than what was employed in raising, preparing, and
bringing that produce to market</em>” ( [O.U.P.,
Vol. I, pp. 59-60; Garnier,] l.c., pp. 108-09).</p>
<p>The produce of <em>labour</em> [is] not equal to the
<em>value</em> of this produce.  On the contrary (one may
gather) this value is <em>increased</em> by the addition of
profit and rent.  The produce of labour can therefore
command, purchase, more labour, i.e., pay a greater value in
labour, than the labour contained in it.  This
proposition would be correct if it ran like this:</p>
<table class="quote">

  therefore employed) “in raising, preparing, and
  bringing that produce to market.”
  </td>

</table>
<p>(Here Smith returns again to his second conception of
value, a concept of which he writes the following in the
same chapter.</p>
<p class="quote">“The real value of all the different
component parts of price, it must be observed, is measured
by the quantity of labour which they can, each of them,
purchase or command.  Labour” (in this sense)
“measures the value, not only of that part of price
which resolves itself into labour” (should read: into
wages) “but of that which resolves itself into rent,
and of that which resolves itself into profit”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 55; Garnier,] l. I, ch. VI,
p. 100).</p>
<p>(In Chapter VI, the resolution of value into wages,
profit and rent is still dominant.  It is only in
Chapter VII, on the natural price and market-price, that the
compounding of the price from these constituent elements
wins the upper hand.)</p>
<p>Hence: The exchangeable value of the annual product of
labour consists not only of the wages of the labour employed
in order to bring forth this product, but also of profit and
rent.  This labour however is only commanded or
purchased with that part of the value which resolves into
wages.  It is thus possible to set into motion a much
larger amount of labour, if a part of the profit and rent is
used to command or purchase labour, i.e., if it is converted
into wages.  So it amounts to this: the exchangeable
value of the annual product of labour resolves itself into
paid labour (wages) and unpaid labour (profit and
rent).  If therefore a part of that part of the value
which resolves itself into unpaid labour is converted into
wages, one can purchase a greater quantity of labour than if
one merely assigns that part of the value which consists of
wages, to the purchase of new labour.)</p>
<p>Let us go back then:</p>
<p class="quote">“An independent manufacturer, who has
stock enough both to purchase materials, and to maintain
himself till he can carry his work to market, should gain
both the wages of a journeyman who works under a master, and
the profit which that master makes by the sale of that
journeyman’s work.  His whole gains, however, are
commonly called profit, and wages are, in this case too,
confounded with profit.</p>
<p class="quote">“A gardener who cultivates his own
garden with his own hands, unites in his own person the
<em>three different characters of landlord, farmer, and
labourer</em>.  His produce, therefore, should pay him
the rent of the first, the profit of the second, and the
wages of the third.  The whole, however, is commonly
considered as the <em>earnings of his labour</em>.  Both
rent and profit are, in this case, confounded with
wages” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 59; Garnier,] l. I,
ch. VI, p.  108).</p>
<p>This is indeed confounded.  Is not the <em>whole</em>
“the earnings of his labour”?  And are not,
on the contrary, the conditions of capitalist
production—in which, with the alienation of labour
from its objective conditions, the worker, capitalist and
landowner confront one another as different characters
too—transferred to this gardener, so that the product
of his labour or rather the value of the product is
regarded, part of it as wages, in payment of his labour,
part of it as profit, on account of the capital employed,
and part of it as rent, as the portion due to the land or
rather the proprietor of the land?  <em>Within</em>
capitalist production(it is) quite correct, when considering
those conditions of labour in which these elements are
<em>not</em> separated (in actual fact), to assume them to be
separated and so to regard this gardener as his own <span class="context">||622|</span> journeyman and as his own
landowner in one person.  The vulgar conception however
that wages arise from labour, but profit and
rent—independently of the labour of the
worker—arise out of capital and land as separate
sources, not for the appropriation of alien labour, but of
wealth itself, evidently creeps into Adam Smith’s writing
already at this stage.  In this fantastic fashion, the
profoundest concepts intermingle with the craziest notions,
such as the common mind forms in an abstract manner from the
phenomena of competition.</p>
<p>Having first <em>resolved</em> value into wages, profits,
rents, he then on the contrary <em>compounds</em> value out of
wages, profit and rent, whose magnitudes are determined
independently of value.  Since Adam Smith has thus
forgotten the origin of profit and rent correctly explained
by himself, he is able to say:</p>
<p class="quote">“Wages, profit, and rent, are the
<em>three original sources</em> of all <em>revenue</em>, <em>a s
w e l l  a s of all exchangeable value</em>”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 57; Garnier,] l. I, ch.  VI,
p. 105).</p>
<p>In accordance with his own explanation, he should have
said:</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>value</em> of a commodity
arises exclusively out of the labour (the amount of labour)
which is embodied in this commodity.  This value
resolves itself into wages, profit and rent.  Wages,
profit and rent are the original forms in which the worker,
the capitalist and the landlord participate in the value
created by the labour of the worker.  In this sense
they are the three original <em>sources of all revenue</em>,
although none of these so-called sources enters into the
formation of the value.”</p>
<p>From the passages quoted it can be seen how in Chapter
VI, on the “<em>Component Parts of the Price of
Commodities</em>”, Adam Smith arrives at the resolution
of price into wages, where only (immediate) labour enters
into the production; into wages and profit, where, instead
of the independent workman, a journeyman is employed by a
capitalist (i.e., capital); and finally into wages, profit
and rent, where “land” enters into the
production besides capital and labour.  In this latter
case, however, it is assumed that the land is appropriated,
that consequently alongside the worker and the capitalist,
there is also a landowner (although he notes that it is
possible for all three or two of these characters to be
united in one person).</p>
<p>In <em>Chapter VII</em>, on <em>natural price</em> and
<em>market-price</em>, rent (where land enters into the
production) is presented as a component part of the natural
price in exactly the same way as wages and profit.  The
following passages will show this:</p>
<p>(Book I, <em>Chapter VII</em>).</p>
<p class="quote">“When the price of any commodity is
neither more nor less than what is sufficient to pay the
<em>r e n t o f the land, the wages of the labour</em>, and
the <em>profits of the stock</em> employed in raising,
preparing, and bringing it to market, according to their
<em>natural</em> rates, the commodity is then sold for what
may he called <em>its natural price</em>.</p>
<p class="quote">“The commodity is then sold
<em>precisely</em> for <em>what it is worth</em>”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 61; Garnier,] l.c., p. 111). (At the
same time, it is stated here that the natural price is
identical with the value of the commodity.)</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>market price</em> of every
particular commodity is regulated by the proportion between
the quantity which is actually brought to market, and the
demand of those who are willing to pay the <em>natural
price</em> of the commodity, or the <em>whole value of the
rent</em>, labour, and profit, <em>which must be paid in order
to bring it thither</em>” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 61-62;
Garnier,] l.c., p. 112).</p>
<p class="quote">“When the quantity of any commodity
which is brought to market <em>Jolts short of</em> the
effectual demand, all those who are willing to pay the
<em>whole value o f  t h e  r e n t, wages, and
profit</em>, which must be paid in order to bring it thither,
cannot be supplied with the quantity which they want
… the <em>market price</em> will rise more or less
<em>above</em> the <em>natural price</em>, according as either
the <em>greatness of the deficiency</em>, or <em>the wealth</em>
and wanton luxury of the competitors, happen to animate more
or less the eagerness of the competition” ([O.U.P.,
Vol. I, p. 62; Garnier,] l.c., p.  113).</p>
<p class="quote">“When the quantity brought to market
exceeds the effectual demand, it cannot be all sold to those
who are willing to pay the whole value of the rent, wages,
and profit, which must be paid in order to bring it
thither…  The <em>market price</em> will sink more
or less below the <em>natural price</em>, according as the
greatness of the excess increases more or less the
competition of the sellers, or according as it happens to be
more or less important to them to get immediately rid of the
commodity” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 62-63; Garnier,]
l.c., p. 114).</p>
<p class="quote">“When the quantity brought to market
is just sufficient to supply the effectual demand, and no
more, the <em>market price</em> naturally comes to be …
exactly …, the same with the <em>natural
price</em>…  The competition of the different
dealers obliges them all to accept of this price, but does
not oblige them to accept of less” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
p. 63; Garnier,] l.c., pp.  114-15).</p>
<p><span class="context">||623|</span> If, in consequence of
the state of the market, his rent sinks below, or rises
above, its natural rate, Adam Smith allows the landowner to
<em>withdraw his land</em> or transfer it from the production
of one commodity (such as wheat) to that of <em>another</em>
(such as pasture for instance).</p>
<p class="quote">“If at any time it” (the
quantity brought to market) “exceeds the effectual
demand, some of the component parts of its price must be
paid below their <em>natural rate.  I f  i t 
i s  r e n t</em>, the interest of the landlords will
immediately prompt them to <em>withdraw a part of their
land</em>” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 63; Garnier,] l.c.,
p. 115).</p>
<p class="quote">“If, on the contrary, the quantity
brought to market should at any time <em>fall short of the
effectual demand</em>, some of the component parts of its
price must rise above their <em>natural</em> rate.  <em>I
f  i t  i s  r e n t</em>, the interest
of all other landlords will naturally prompt them to prepare
more land for the raising of this commodity” ([O.U.P.,
Vol. I, p. 63; Garnier,] l.c., p. 116).</p>
<p class="quote">“The occasional and temporary
fluctuations in the <em>market price</em> of any commodity
fall chiefly upon those parts of its price which resolve
themselves into wages and profit.  That part which
resolves itself into rent is less affected by them”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 65; Garnier,] l.c., pp. 118-19).</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>price of monopoly</em> is
upon every occasion the highest which can be got.  The
<em>natural price</em>, or the price of free competition, on
the contrary, is the lowest which can be taken, not upon
every occasion indeed, but for any considerable time
together” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 68; Garnier,] l.c.,
p. 124).</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>market price</em> of any
particular commodity, though it may continue long above, can
seldom continue long below, its <em>natural price. 
Whatever part</em> of <em>it was paid below the natural
rate</em>, the persons whose interest it affected would
immediately feel the loss, and would <em>immediately
withdraw</em> either so <em>much land</em>, or so much labour,
or so much stock, from being employed about it, that the
quantity brought to market would soon he no more than
sufficient to supply the effectual demand.  Its
<em>market price</em>, therefore, would soon rise to the
<em>natural price;</em> this at least would he the case where
there was perfect liberty” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
pp. 68-69; Garnier,] l.c., p. 125).</p>
<p>After this exposition of the subject in Chapter VII, it
is difficult to see how Adam Smith can justify his
proposition in Book I, Chapter XI, “<em>Of the Rent of
Land</em>”, that rent does not always enter into price
where appropriated land enters into production; how he can
differentiate between the manner in which rent enters into
price from that in which profit and wages enter into it,
since in chapters VI and VII he has turned rent into a
<em>component part</em> of the <em>natural price</em>, in just
the same way as profit and wages.  Now let us return to
this Chapter XI (Book I).</p>
<p>We have seen that there rent is defined as the
<em>surplus</em> which remains from the <em>price of the
product</em>, after the expenses of the capitalist (farmer)
plus the average profit have been paid.</p>
<p>In this Chapter XI, Smith makes a complete
turn-about.  Rent no longer enters into the <em>natural
price</em>.  Or, rather, Adam Smith takes refuge in an
<em>ordinary price</em> which is as a rule different from the
natural price, although we were told in Chapter VII, that
the ordinary price can never, for any length of time, be
<em>below</em> the natural price and that none of the
component parts of the natural price can for any length of
time, be paid below its natural rate and even less, not paid
at all, as he now asserts in relation to rent.  Neither
does Adam Smith tell us whether the produce is sold <em>below
its value</em> when it pays no rent, or whether it is sold
<em>above</em> its value, when it pays rent.</p>
<p>Previously, the <em>natural price</em> of the commodity
was</p>
<p class="quote">“the <em>whole value of the rent</em>,
labour, and profit, <em>which must be paid in order to bring
it thither</em>” [to market] ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
pp. 61-62, Garnier,] l.c., p. 112).</p>
<p>Now we are told that:</p>
<p class="quote">“Such parts <em>only</em> of the
produce of land <em>can commonly be brought to market</em>, of
which the <em>ordinary price</em> is sufficient <em>to replace
the stock which must be employed in bringing them thither,
together with its ordinary profits</em>” ([O.U.P.,
Vol. I, p. 164; Garnier,] l.c., pp.  302-03).</p>
<p>The <em>ordinary price</em> is therefore not the <em>natural
price</em>, and the natural price need not be paid, in order
to bring these commodities to market.</p>
<p><span class="context">||624|</span> Previously we were
told that if the <em>ordinary price</em> (that time, the
<em>market-price</em>) were not sufficient to pay the <em>whole
rent</em> (“the whole value of the rent,” etc.),
land will be withdrawn until the market-price rises to the
level of the natural price and pays the whole rent. 
Now, on the other hand:</p>
<p class="quote">“If the <em>ordinary price is more
than this</em>” (sufficient to replace the stock
together with its ordinary profits), “the
<em>surplus</em> part of it will naturally go to the rent of
the land.  If it is not more, though the <em>commodity
may be brought to market</em>, it can afford no rent to the
landlord.  Whether the price is, or is not more,
depends upon the demand” ([O.U.P., Vol. 1, p.  164;
Garnier,] l. I, ch. XI, p. 303).</p>
<p>Thus rent, from being a component part of the <em>natural
price</em> suddenly turns into a <em>surplus</em> over the
<em>sufficient price,<a href="#-ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[a]</a></em> a surplus whose existence or
non-existence depends on the state of demand.  But the
<em>sufficient price</em> is that price which is required for
the commodity to appear on the market, and therefore to be
produced, thus it is the <em>price of production</em> of the
commodity.  For the price which is required for the
supply of the commodity, the price which is required for it
to come into existence at all, to appear as a commodity on
the market, is of course its <em>price of production</em> or
<em>cost-price</em>, That [is the condition] <em>sine qua
non</em> of the existence of the commodity.  On the
other hand the demand for certain products of the land must
always be such that their <em>ordinary price</em> pays a
surplus over and above the price of production, that is, a
rent.  For others it may or may not be so.</p>
<p class="quote">“There are some parts of the produce
of land for which the demand must always be such as to
afford a greater price than what is sufficient to bring them
to market; and there are others for which it either may or
may not be such as to <em>afford</em> this greater
<em>price</em>.  The former must always afford a rent to
the landlord.  The latter sometimes may, and sometimes
may not, according to different circumstances”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 164-65; Garnier,] l. I, ch. XI,
p. 303).</p>
<p>So instead of the <em>natural price</em> we have the
<em>sufficient price</em> here.  The <em>ordinary
price</em>, in turn, is different from this <em>sufficient
price</em>.  The ordinary price if it <em>includes</em>
the rent is <em>above</em> the sufficient price.  If it
does not comprise rent it is equal to the sufficient
price.  It is even characteristic of the <em>sufficient
price that rent is excluded</em>.  The ordinary price is
<em>below</em> the sufficient price, when it does not pay the
average profit, in addition to replacing the capital. 
Thus the <em>sufficient price</em> is in fact the <em>price of
production</em> or <em>cost-price</em> as abstracted by Ricardo
from Adam Smith and as it indeed presents itself from the
standpoint of capitalist production, in other words the
price which, apart from the outlay of the capitalist, pays
the ordinary profit; [it is] the average price brought about
by the competition of capitalists in the different
employments of capital.  It is this abstraction based
on competition which induces Adam Smith to confront his
<em>natural price</em> with the <em>sufficient price</em>,
although in his presentation of the natural price he on the
contrary declares that in the long run only the ordinary
price which pays rent, profit and wages, the component parts
of the natural price, is sufficient.  Since the
capitalist controls the production of commodities, the
sufficient price is [that] which is sufficient for
capitalist production from the standpoint of capital and the
price which is sufficient for capital does not include rent,
but, on the contrary, excludes it.</p>
<p>On the other hand: This <em>sufficient price</em> is not
sufficient for some products of the land.  For them the
<em>ordinary price</em> must be high enough to yield a surplus
over and above the sufficient price, a rent for the
landowner.  For others it depends on the
circumstances.  The contradiction that the sufficient
price is not sufficient—that the price which suffices
to bring the product to market does not suffice to bring it
to market—does not worry Adam Smith.</p>
<p>Although he does not turn back, even for one moment, to
glance at chapters V, VI and VII, he admits to himself (not
as a contradiction, but as a new discovery which he has
suddenly hit upon), that with the sufficient price, he has
overthrown his whole doctrine of natural price.</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>Rent</em>, it is to be
<em>observed</em>, therefore” (in this extraordinarily
naive fashion Adam Smith progresses from an assertion to its
very opposite), “<em>enters into the composition of the
price of commodities in a different way from wages and
profit.  High or low wages and profit are the causes of
high or low price</em> <span class="context">||625|</span>;
<em>high or low rent</em> is the effect <em>of it.  It is
because high or low wages and profit must be paid, in
order</em> to <em>bring a particular commodity to market</em>,
that its price is high or low.  But it is because its
price is high or low, <em>a great deal more, or very little
more, or no more, than what is sufficient to pay those wages
and profit</em>, that it affords a high rent, or a low rent,
or no rent at all” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p.  165;
Garnier,] l.c., pp. 303-04).</p>
<p>Let us take the final proposition first.  The
<em>sufficient price</em>, the cost-price, which only pays
wages and profit, <em>excludes rent</em>.  If the product
pays <em>a great deal more than the sufficient price</em>,
then it pays a high rent.  If it pays only a little
more, then it pays a low rent.  If it pays <em>only
exactly the sufficient price</em>, then it pays <em>no</em>
rent.  It pays <em>no</em> rent if the actual price of
the product coincides with the <em>sufficient price</em>,
which pays profit and wages.  Rent is always a
<em>surplus</em> over and above the sufficient price.  By
its very nature, the sufficient price excludes rent. 
<em>This is Ricardo’s theory</em>.  He accepts the
concept of the <em>sufficient price</em>, the cost-price, from
Adam Smith; but avoids Adam Smith’s inconsistency of
differentiating it from the natural price, and sets it forth
consistently.  Having committed all these
inconsistencies, Smith is sufficiently inconsistent to
demand, for certain products of the land, a price which is
<em>higher</em> than their <em>sufficient price</em>.  But
this inconsistency itself is in turn the result of a <em>more
correct</em> “observation”.</p>
<p>The beginning of the passage is truly amazing in its
naiveté.  In Chapter VII Smith explained that
rent, profit and wages enter equally into the <em>corn
position of the natural price</em>, having first turned the
<em>dissolution of value</em> into rent, profit and wages
upside down and transformed it into the composition of value
from the natural price of rent, profit and wages.  Now
he tells us that rent enters into “the <em>composition
of the price</em> of commodities” <em>differently</em>
from profit and wages.  And in what way does it enter
<em>differently</em> into <em>that composition?</em> By
<em>not</em> entering into that composition <em>at
all</em>.  And here we are first given a true
explanation of the sufficient price.  The <em>price of
the commodities</em> is dear or cheap, high or low, because
wages and profit—their natural rates—are high or
low.  The commodity will not be brought to market, will
not be produced, unless these high or low profits and wages
are paid.  They form the <em>price of production</em> of
the commodity, its <em>cost-price;</em> and are thus in fact,
the <em>constituent elements of its value</em> or
<em>price</em>.  <em>Rent</em>, on the other hand, does not
enter into the <em>cost-price</em>, the <em>price of
production</em>.  It is not a constituent element of the
exchangeable value of the commodity.  It is <em>only</em>
paid when the <em>ordinary price</em> of the commodity is
<em>above</em> its <em>sufficient</em> price.  Profit and
wages as <em>constituent elements</em> of the price are
<em>causes</em> of the price; rent, on the other hand, is only
its <em>effect</em>, its <em>result</em>.  It does not,
therefore, enter into the composition of the price as an
element, as do profit and wages.  And this is what
Smith calls entering into this composition in a
<em>different</em> way from profit and wages.  He does
not appear to be in the slightest bit aware of the fact that
he has thrown over his doctrine of natural price.  For
what was the natural price?  The central point around
which the market-price gravitated: the <em>sufficient price,
below</em> which in the long run the product could not fall,
if it were to be produced and brought to market.</p>
<p>Thus rent is now the <em>surplus over the natural
price</em>, previously [it was] a <em>component part of the
natural price;</em> now [it is the] effect, previously [it
was] the cause, of price.</p>
<p>There is however no contradiction in Adam Smith’s
assertion that for certain products of the land, the
circumstances of the market are always such that their
ordinary price must be above their sufficient price, in
other words: that <em>landed property</em> has the power to
force the price above that level which would be sufficient
for the capitalist if he were not confronted by a
counteracting influence.</p>
<p><span class="context">||626|</span> Having thus, in
Chapter XI, thrown overboard chapters V, VI and VII, he
calmly proceeds by saying that: he will now make it his
business to consider 1. the produce of the land which always
affords rent; 2. the produce of the land which sometimes
affords rent and sometimes not; finally 3.  the variations
which take place, in the different periods of development of
society, in the relative value, partly of these two sorts of
produce compared with one another and partly in their
relationship to manufactured commodities.<a name="s2"> </a></p>
<h3>[2.  Adam Smith’s Hypothesis Regarding the Special
Character of the Demand for Agricultural Produce. 
Physiocratic Elements in Smith’s Theory of Rent]</h3>
<p>“<em>Part I.  Of the Produce of
Land which always affords Rent</em>.”</p>
<p>Adam Smith begins with the theory of population. 
The <em>mean s of subsistence</em> always create a
<em>demand</em> for themselves.  If the means of subsistence
increase, then the people, the consumers of the means of
subsistence, also increase.  The supply of these
commodities thus <em>creates</em> the demand for them.</p>
<p class="quote">“As men, like all other animals,
<em>naturally multiply in proportion to the means of
their subsistence, food is always more or less in
demand</em>.  It can always purchase or command a
greater or smaller quantity of labour, and somebody can
always be found who is willing to do something in order to
obtain it” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 165; Garnier,] l. I,
ch.  XI p. 305).</p>
<p class="quote">“But &lt;why?&gt; “<em>land</em>,
in almost any situation, <em>produces a greater quantity of
food</em> than what is sufficient <em>to maintain all the
labour</em> necessary for bringing it to market, in the most
liberal way in which that labour is ever maintained. 
The <em>surplus</em>, too, is always more than sufficient to
<em>replace the stock which employed that labour, together
with its profits</em>.  Something, therefore, always
remains for a rent to the landlord” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
p. 166; Garnier,] l.c., pp. 305-06).</p>
<p>This sounds quite <em>physiocratic</em> and contains
neither proof nor explanation of why the
“<em>price</em>” of these particular commodities
pays a rent, a surplus over and <em>above</em> the
“sufficient price”.</p>
<p>As an example he immediately refers to <em>pasture</em> and
<em>uncultivated pasture</em>.  Then follows the
proposition on <em>differential rent:</em></p>
<p class="quote">“The rent of land not only varies
with its fertility, whatever be its produce, but with its
situation, whatever be its fertility” ([ibid., p.
166] l.c., p. 133).</p>
<p>On this occasion rent and profit appear as mere
<em>surplus</em> of the <em>product</em>, after that part of it
has been deducted <em>in kind</em> which <em>feeds</em> the
<em>worker</em>.  (This is really the physiocratic view,
which is based on the fact that in an agricultural country
man lives almost exclusively on the agricultural product,
and industry manufacture, itself appears as a rural
side-line which uses the <em>local product</em> of
nature.)</p>
<p class="quote">“A greater quantity of labour,
therefore, must be maintained out of it<a href="#-ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[b]</a>; and the <em>surplus, from which are
drawn both the profit of the farmer</em> and <em>the rent of
the landlord</em>, must be diminished” ([O.U.P.,
Vol. I, p. 166; Garnier,] l.c., p.  307).</p>
<p>The growing of corn must therefore yield a greater profit
than <em>pasture</em>.</p>
<p class="quote">“A <em>cornfield</em> of moderate
fertility produces a much <em>greater quantity of food for
man</em> than the best pasture of equal extent.”</p>
<p>(Thus it is not a question of price here, but of the
absolute quantity of food for man.)</p>
<p class="quote">“Though its cultivation requires
<em>much more labour</em>, yet the <em>surplus</em> which
remains after replacing the seed and <em>maintaining all that
labour</em>, is likewise much greater.”</p>
<p>(Although corn costs <em>more labour</em>, the cornfield
yields a larger <em>surplus</em> of food, after labour has
been paid, than a meadow used for stock raising.  And
it is <em>worth more</em>, not because corn costs more labour,
but because the surplus in corn contains more
nourishment.)</p>
<p class="quote">“If a pound of butcher’s meat,
therefore, was <em>never</em> supposed to be <em>worth more</em>
than a pound of bread, this <em>greater surplus</em>”
(because the same area of land yields more pounds of corn
than meat) “would everywhere be of <em>greater
value</em>,” &lt;because it is <em>assumed</em>, that a
pound of bread equals a pound of meat (in value), and that,
after the workers have been fed, more pounds of bread than
pounds of meat are left over from the same area of land&gt;
“and constitute a greater fund both for the profit of
the farmer and the <em>rent</em> of the landlord”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 167-68; Garnier,] l.c.,
pp. 308-09).</p>
<p>Having replaced the natural price by the sufficient
price, and declared rent to be the surplus over and above
the sufficient price, Smith forgets altogether, that it is a
question of <em>price</em>, and derives rent from the ratio
between the amount of <em>food</em> yielded by agriculture and
the amount of <em>food</em> consumed by the agricultural
worker.</p>
<p>In point of fact—apart from this
<em>physiocratic</em> interpretation—he
<em>postulates</em> that the <em>price</em> of the agricultural
product which supplies the principal food pays <em>rent</em>
in addition to profit.  This is the starting-point for
his further arguments.  With the extension of
cultivation, the natural pastures become insufficient for
stock raising and cannot satisfy the demand for butcher’s
meat.  Cultivated land has to be employed for this
purpose.  <span class="context">||627|</span> The price
of meat therefore has to rise to the point where it pays not
only the <em>labour</em> which is employed in stock raising,
but also:</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>the rent which the landlord, and
the profit which the farmer, could have drawn from such land
employed in tillage</em>.  The cattle bred upon the most
uncultivated moors, when brought to the same market, are, in
proportion to their weight or goodness, sold at the same
price as those which are reared upon the most improved
land.  The proprietors of those moors profit by it, and
raise the rent of their land in <em>proportion to the price
of their cattle</em>.”</p>
<p>(In this passage Adam Smith correctly derives the
differential rent from the surplus of the market-value over
the individual value.  In this case, however, the
market-value rises, not because there is a transition from
better to worse, but from less fertile to more fertile
land.)</p>
<p class="quote">“It is thus that, in the progress of
improvement, the <em>rent and profit of unimproved
pasture</em> come to be regulated in some measure by the rent
and profit of what is improved, and <em>these again by the
rent and profit of corn</em>” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
pp. 168-69; Garnier,] pp. 310-11).</p>
<p class="quote">“But where there is no Local
advantage of this kind, the rent and profit of corn, or
whatever else is the common vegetable food of the people,
must naturally regulate, upon the land which is <em>fit</em>
for producing it, the rent and profit of pasture.</p>
<p class="quote">“The use of the artificial grasses,
of turnips, carrots, cabbages, and <em>the other
expedients</em> which have been fallen upon to make an
<em>equal quantity of land feed a greater number of cattle
than when in natural grass</em>, should somewhat reduce, it
might be expected, the superiority which, in an improved
country, the price of butcher’s meat naturally has over that
of bread.  It seems accordingly to have done so”
etc.  ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 171; Garnier,] l.c.,
p. 315).</p>
<p>Having thus set forth the <em>relationship between rent
yielded by pasture and by tilled land</em>, Smith
continues:</p>
<p class="quote">“In all great countries, the greater
part of the cultivated lands are employed in producing
either food for men or food for cattle.  The rent and
profit of these regulate the rent and profit of all other
cultivated land.  If any particular produce afforded
less, the land would soon be turned into corn or pasture;
and if any afforded more, some part of the lands in corn or
pasture would soon be turned to that produce”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 172-73; Garnier,] l.c., p. 318).</p>
<p>Then he speaks of vineyards, fruit and vegetable gardens,
etc</p>
<p class="quote">“The rent and profit of those
productions, therefore, which require either a greater
original expense of improvement in order to fit the land for
them, or a greater annual expense of cultivation, though
often much superior to those of corn and pasture, yet when
they do no more than compensate such extraordinary expense,
are in reality regulated by the rent and profit of those
common crops” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 176; Garnier,]
pp. 323-24).</p>
<p>Then he passes on to sugar cultivation in the colonies
[and] tobacco.</p>
<p class="quote">“It is in this manner that the rent
of the cultivated land, of which the produce is human food,
regulates the rent of the greater part of other cultivated
land.”</p>
<p class="quote">“In Europe, corn is the principal
produce of land, which serves immediately for human
food.  Except in particular situations, therefore, the
rent of corn-land regulates in Europe that of all other
cultivated land” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 180; Garnier,]
l.c., pp. 331-32).</p>
<p>Adam Smith then returns to the physiocratic theory, as
interpreted by him, namely that food creates consumers for
itself.  [He asserts that] if corn were replaced by
some other crop, which with the same amount of labour
yielded a much greater quantity of food on the most common
land, then</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>the rent</em> of the landlord,
<em>o r the sur plus quantity of food</em> which would remain
to him, after paying the labour, and replacing the stock of
the farmer, together with its ordinary profits, would
necessarily be much greater.  Whatever was the rate at
which labour was commonly maintained in that country, this
<em>greater surplus could always maintain a greater quantity
of it</em>, and, <em>consequently</em>, enable the landlord to
purchase or command a greater quantity of it”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 181; Garnier,] l.c., p. 332).</p>
<p>Adam Smith cites rice as an <em>example</em>.</p>
<p class="quote">“In Carolina … the
<em>planters</em>, as in other British colonies, <em>are
generally both farmers and landlords</em>, and <em>rent,
consequently, is confounded with profit</em>” ([O.U.P.,
Vol. I, p. 181; Garnier,] l.c., p. 333).</p>
<p><span class="context">||628|</span> The rice field,
however</p>
<p class="quote">“is unfit either for corn, or
pasture, or vineyard, or, indeed, for any other vegetable
produce that is very useful to men; and the lands which are
fit for those purposes are not fit for rice.  Even in
the rice countries, therefore, the rent of rice lands cannot
regulate the rent of the other cultivated land which can
never be turned to that produce” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
pp. 181-82; Garnier,] l.c., p. 334).</p>
<p><em>Second example potatoes</em> (Ricardo’s criticism of
this has been mentioned earlier).  If potatoes became
the principal food, in place of corn,</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>…the same quantity of
cultivated land</em> would <em>maintain a much greater number
of people;</em> and the labourers being generally fed with
potatoes, a greater <em>surplus</em> would remain after
replacing all the stock, and maintaining all the labour
employed <em>in</em> cultivation.  A greater share of
this surplus, too, would belong to the landlord. 
Population would increase, and rents would rise much beyond
what they are at present” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p.  182;
Garnier,] l.c., p. 335).</p>
<p>A few more comments on wheaten bread, bread made of
oatmeal, and on potatoes conclude the first section of
Chapter XI.</p>
<p>One can therefore sum up this section, which deals with
the product of land <em>which always pays a rent</em>, as
follows: after <em>postulating</em> the rent of the principal
vegetable food, it sets forth how this rent regulates the
rent of cattle-breeding, wine-growing, market gardening,
etc.  There is <em>nothing</em> about the nature of rent
itself, except the general thesis that, <em>provided</em> rent
exists, its amount is determined by fertility and
situation.  But this only relates to differences in
rents, differences in the magnitude of rents.  But why
does his product always pay a rent?  Why is its
<em>ordinary price</em> always higher than its <em>sufficient
price?</em> Smith leaves price out of account here and
reverts to the physiocratic theory.  What runs through
it, however, is that the <em>demand</em> is always so great
because the product itself creates the demand, [since it
creates] its own consumers.  Even provided that this
were so it is incomprehensible why the demand should rise
above the supply and thus force the price <em>above</em> the
sufficient price.  But there is here a secret
recollection of the image of the <em>natural price</em> which
includes rent as well as profit and wages and which is paid
when supply corresponds with demand.</p>
<p class="quote">“When the quantity brought to market
is just sufficient to supply the effectual demand, and no
more, the <em>market price</em> naturally comes to be …
exactly … the same with the <em>natural
price</em>” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 63; Garnier,] l.c.,
p. 114).</p>
<p>It is however characteristic that Adam Smith nowhere in
this section states this clearly.  In opening Chapter
XI, he had just said that rent does not enter into price as
a component part.  The contradiction was too
conspicuous.<a name="s3"> </a></p>
<h3>[3.  Adam Smith’s Explanation of How the Relation
Between Supply and Demand Affects the Various Types of
Products from the Land.  Smith’s Conclusions Regarding
the Theory of Rent]</h3>
<p>“<em>Part II: Of the Produce of Land which sometimes
does, and sometimes does not, afford Rent</em>.”</p>
<p>It is actually only in this section that the general
nature of rent is first discussed.</p>
<p class="quote">“Human <em>food</em> seems to he the
only produce of land, which <em>always</em> and
<em>necessarily</em> affords some <em>rent to the
landlord</em>.” (Why “always” and
“necessarily”, has not been shown.) 
“Other sorts of produce sometimes may, and sometimes
may not, according to different circumstances”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 183; Garnier,] l.c., p. 337).</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>After food, clothing and
lodging</em> are the two great wants of mankind.</p>
<p class="quote">“Land, in its original rude state,
can afford the materials of clothing and lodging to a
<em>much greater number of people</em> than it can
<em>feed</em>.” As a result of this
“<em>superabundance</em> of those materials” in
proportion to the number of people the land can feed, i.e.,
in proportion to the population, these materials
“cost” little or nothing.  A large part of
these “materials” lies around unused and useless
“and the price of what is used is <em>considered as
equal only to the labour and expense of fitting it for
use</em>.” This price however affords “no rent to
the landlord”.  On the other hand, where the land
is in an improved state, the number of people whom “it
can feed”, i.e., the population, is greater than the
quantity of those materials which it supplies, at least
“in the way in which they require them, and are
willing to pay for them”.  There is a relative
“scarcity” of these materials “which
necessarily augments their value” …
“there is <em>frequently a demand for more than can be
had</em>.” More is paid for them than “the
expense of bringing them to market.  Their price,
therefore, can always <em>afford some rent</em> to the
landlord” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 184; Garnier,] l.c.,
pp. 338 to 339).</p>
<p><span class="context">||629|</span> Here therefore an
explanation of rent [is] derived, from the <em>excess of
demand</em> over the <em>supply</em> which can be provided at
the <em>sufficient price</em>.</p>
<p class="quote">The original materials of clothing were the furs and
skins “of the larger animals”.  Among
nations of hunters and shepherds, whose food consists
chiefly of the flesh of animals, “every man, <em>by
providing himself with food, provides himself with the
materials of more clothing than he can wear</em>
“.  Without foreign trade, the greater part of
them would be thrown away as useless.  Through the
additional demand provided by foreign trade, the price of
this surplus of materials is raised “<em>above what it
costs to send them” to be sold</em>.  This price
“affords, <em>therefore</em>, some rent to the
landlord”.  Through its market in Flanders,
English wool thus added “something to the rent of the
land which produced it” ([O.U.P., Vol.  I, pp. 184-85;
Garnier,] l.c., pp. 339-40).</p>
<p>Foreign trade here raises the <em>price</em> of an
agricultural by-product to such an extent, that the land
which produces it can yield some rent.</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>materials of lodging</em>
cannot always be transported to so great a distance as those
of clothing, and do not so readily become an object of
foreign commerce.  When they are <em>superabundant</em>
in the country which produces them, it frequently happens,
even in the present commercial state of the world, that they
are <em>of no value to the landlord</em>.” Thus a stone
quarry in the neighbourhood of London may yield a rent,
whereas in many parts of Scotland and Wales, it may
not.  Similarly with timber.  “In a populous
and well-cultivated country” it will provide a rent,
but “in many parts of North America” it will rot
on the ground.  The landowner would be glad to get rid
of it.  “When the materials of lodging are so
superabundant, the part made use of is worth only the labour
and expense of fitting it for that use.  It affords no
rent to the landlord, who generally grants the use of it to
whoever takes the trouble of asking it.  The
<em>demand</em> of wealthier nations, however, sometimes
enables him to get a rent for it” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
pp. 185-86; Garnier,] l.c., pp. 340-41).</p>
<p class="quote">Countries are populated, not in proportion to the
“number of people whom their produce <em>can clothe and
lodge</em>, but in proportion to that <em>of</em> those <em>whom
it can feed</em>.  When food is provided, it is easy to
find the necessary clothing and lodging.  But though
these are at hand, it may often be difficult to find
food.  In some parts of the British Dominions, what is
called a house may be built by one day’s labour of one
man.” Among savage and barbarous nations, a hundredth
of the labour of a whole year will be sufficient to provide
them with what they require in clothing and lodging. 
The other 99 hundredths [are] often necessary to provide
them with the food they need.  “But when, by the
improvement and cultivation of land, the <em>labour of one
family can provide food for two</em>, the labour of half the
society becomes sufficient to provide food for the
whole.” The other half can then <em>satisfy</em> the
other wants and fancies of mankind.  The principal
objects of those wants and fancies are <em>clothing, lodging,
household furniture</em>, and what is called
<em>luxury</em>.  The desire for food is limited. 
Those other desires are unlimited.  Those who possess a
surplus of food “are always willing to exchange the
surplus”.  “The poor, in order <em>to obtain
food</em>”, exert themselves to satisfy those
“fancies” of the rich, and, moreover, compete
with one another <em>in</em> their endeavours.  The
number of workmen increases with the quantity of food, i.e.,
in proportion to the progress of agriculture.  [The
nature of] their “business admits of the utmost
subdivisions of labour”; the quantity of materials
which they work up therefore increases even more rapidly
than their numbers.  “Hence arises a demand for
every sort of material which human invention can employ,
either usefully or ornamentally, in building, dress,
equipage, or household furniture; for the fossils and
minerals contained in the bowels of the earth, the precious
metals, and the precious stones.</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>Food</em> is, <em>in this
manner</em>, not only the original source of <em>rent</em>, but
every other part of the produce of land which afterwards
affords rent, derives <em>that part of its value from the
improvement of the powers of labour in producing food</em>,
by means of the improvement and cultivation of land”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 186-88; Garnier,] l.c.,
pp. 342-45).</p>
<p>What Smith says here, is the true physical basis of
Physiocracy, namely, that the creation of surplus-value
(including rent) always has its basis in the relative
productivity of agriculture.  The first real form of
surplus-value is surplus of agricultural produce (food) ,
and the first real form of surplus labour arises when one
person is able to produce the food for two.  Otherwise
this has nothing to do with the development of rent, this
specific form of surplus-value, which presupposes capitalist
production.</p>
<p>Adam Smith continues:</p>
<p class="quote">The other parts of the produce of the land (apart from
food), which later afford rent, do not afford it
always.  The <em>demand</em> for them, even in the most
cultivated countries, is not always <em>great enough</em>,
“to afford a greater <em>price than what</em> is
<em>sufficient to pay the labour, and replace, together with
its ordinary profits, the stock which must be employed in
bringing them to market</em>.  <span class="context">||630|</span> <em>Whether it is</em> or <em>is
not such, depends upon different circumstances</em>”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 188; Garnier,] l,c., p. 345).</p>
<p>Here therefore again: Rent arises from the <em>demand</em>
being greater than the supply at the <em>sufficient price</em>
which <em>only includes wages and profits, but no
rent</em>.  What else does this mean, but that the
<em>supply</em> at the sufficient price is so great that
<em>landed property</em> cannot offer any resistance to the
equalisation of capitals or labour?  That therefore,
even though landed property exists legally, it does not
exist in practice, or cannot be effective as such in
practice?  Adam Smith’s mistake is that he fails to
recognise that <em>if</em> landed property sells [products]
<em>above</em> the sufficient price, it sells [them] at their
<em>value</em>.  His positive point, compared with
Ricardo, is that he realises it depends on the
circumstances, whether or not landed property can assert
itself economically.  It is therefore essential to
follow this part of his argument step by step.  He
begins with the coal mine, then goes over to timber and then
returns to the coal mine, etc.  Accordingly we shall
let him start with <em>timber</em>.</p>
<p class="quote">The <em>price of wood</em> varies with the state of
agriculture, for the same reasons as does the price of
cattle.  When agriculture was in its infancy, forests
were dominant and a sheer nuisance to the landowner, who
would gladly give it to anyone for the cutting.  As
agriculture advances, there is clearance of forests, partly
through the expansion of tillage, partly through the
increase in herds of cattle, which eat up, gnaw at, roots
and young trees.  “These” [cattle] though
they do not increase in the same proportion as corn,
<em>which is altogether the acquisition of human
industry</em>, yet multiply under the care and protection of
men.” The scarcity of wood, thus created, raises its
<em>price</em>.  Hence it can afford so high a rent that
tilled land (or land that could be used for tillage) is
converted into woodland.  This is the case in Great
Britain.  The rent of wood can never, for any length of
time, rise above that of corn or pasture, but it <em>may</em>
reach that level ([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 189-90; Garnier,]
l.c., pp. 347-49).</p>
<p>Thus in fact, the rent of woodland is by nature identical
with that of pasture.  It belongs therefore in this
category, although wood does not serve for food.  The
economic category does not depend on the <em>use-value</em> of
the product, but on whether or not it is convertible into
arable land and vice versa.</p>
<p><em>Coal mines</em>.  Smith observes correctly, that
the fertility or in-fertility of mines in general depends on
whether the same quantity of labour can extract a larger or
a smaller amount of mineral from the mine. 
<em>Infertility</em> can offset the <em>favourable</em>
situation, so that such mines cannot be exploited at
all.  On the other hand, an <em>unfavourable</em>
situation can offset the <em>fertility</em>, so that despite
its natural fertility, such a mine cannot be
exploited.  This is in particular the case where there
are neither good roads, nor shipping ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
pp. 188-89; Garnier,] l.c., pp.  346-47).</p>
<p>There are mines whose produce just reaches the
<em>sufficient price</em>.  Hence they pay profit for the
entrepreneur but no rent.  They can therefore be worked
only by the landowner himself.  In this way he gets
“the ordinary profit of the capital which he
employs”.  There are many mines of this type in
Scotland.  These could not be exploited in any other
way.</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>The landlord will allow nobody
else to work them without paying some rent, and nobody can
afford to pay any</em>” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 188;
Garnier,] l.c., p. 346).</p>
<p>Here Adam Smith has correctly defined under what
circumstances land which has been <em>appropriated</em> pays
no rent, namely where landowner and entrepreneur are
<em>one</em> person.  He has already told us earlier that
this is so in the colonies.</p>
<p>A farmer cannot cultivate the land there because he
cannot pay any rent.  But the owner can cultivate it
with profit, although it does not pay him a rent.  This
is the case, for example, in the colonies in Western
America, because new land can always be appropriated. 
The land as such is not an element that offers resistance,
and the competition of landowners who cultivate the land
themselves is here in fact competition between workers or
capitalists.  The position of coal mines, or mines in
general, is different in the supposed circumstances. 
The market-value, as determined by the mines which supply
their product at this value, yields a smaller rent, or no
rent at all but just covers the cost-price in the case of
mines that are less fertile or less favourably
situated.  These mines can only be worked by persons
for whom the resistance of landed property and the
consequent exclusion of others from the land, does not
exist, because they are landowners and capitalists in one
person; [this] only happens where in fact <em>landed
property</em> disappears as an independent element opposed to
capital.  The position differs from that of the
colonies in that: in the latter, the landowner cannot
prohibit the exploitation of <em>new</em> land by
anyone.  In the former he can do so.  He only
gives himself the permission to exploit the mine.  This
does not enable him to draw a rent, but it does enable him
to exclude others and to invest his capital in the mine,
with profit.</p>
<p>What Adam Smith writes about the regulation of rent by
the most fertile mine, I have already commented on, when
discussing Ricardo and his polemic.  Here only one
proposition needs to be stressed:</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>lowest price</em>”
(previously sufficient price) “at which coals can be
sold for any considerable time, is, like that of all other
commodities, the <em>price which is barely sufficient to
replace, together with its ordinary profits, the stock which
must be employed in bringing them to market</em>”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 191; Garnier,] l.c., p. 350).</p>
<p>It is evident that the <em>sufficient price</em> has taken
the place of the <em>natural price</em>, Ricardo regards them
as identical, and rightly so.</p>
<p><span class="context">||631|</span> Smith maintains,</p>
<p class="quote">that the rent of coal mines is much smaller than that of
agricultural products: while with the latter the rent
commonly amount to one third [of the gross produce), in coal
mines a fifth is a very great rent, and a tenth the common
rent.  <em>Metal mines</em> are not so dependent on their
situation, since [their products] are more easily
transported and the world market is therefore open to
them.  Their value, therefore, is more dependent on
their fertility than their situation, while with coal mines,
the opposite is the case.  The products of the most
distant metal mines compete with one another. 
“The price, therefore, of the coarse, and still more
that of the precious metals, <em>at the most fertile
mines</em> in the world, must necessarily more or less affect
their price at every other in it” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
pp. 191-92; Garnier,] l.c., pp. 351-52).</p>
<p class="quote">“The price of every metal, at every
mine, therefore, being regulated in some measure by its
price at the most fertile mine in the world that is actually
wrought, <em>it</em> can, at the greater part of mines, do
<em>very little more than pay the expense of working</em>, and
can <em>seldom</em> afford a very high rent to the
land-lord.  Rent accordingly, seems at the greater part
of mines to have but a small share in the price of the
coarse, and a still smaller in that of the precious
metals.  Labour and profit make up the greater part of
both” ([O.U.P., Vol. I. p. 192; Garnier,] l.c.,
pp. 353-54).</p>
<p>Adam Smith correctly sets forth here the case presented
in <em>Table C</em>.</p>
<p>When speaking of <em>rent</em> in connection with precious
metals.  Adam Smith again gives his interpretation of
the sufficient price, which he puts in the place of the
natural price.  Where he speaks of non-agricultural
industry, he has no need for this, since the sufficient and
the natural price coincide here, according to his original
explanation namely that it is the price which repays the
capital outlay plus the average profit.</p>
<p class="quote">“The lowest price at which the
precious metals can be sold … during any considerable
time, is regulated by the same principles which fix the
lowest ordinary price of all other goods.  The stock
which must commonly be employed, the food, clothes, and
lodging, which must commonly be consumed in bringing them
from the mine to the market, determine it.  It must at
least he sufficient to replace that stock, with the ordinary
profits” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 195; Garnier,] l.c.,
p. 359).</p>
<p>With regard to <em>precious stones</em>, he observes
that:</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>demand for the precious
stones</em> arises altogether from their beauty.  They
are of no use but as ornaments; and the merit of their
beauty is <em>greatly enhanced by their scarcity, or by the
difficulty and expense of getting them from the mine</em>,
Wages and profit accordingly make up, upon most occasions,
almost the whole of the high price.  Rent comes in but
for a very small share, frequently no share; and the most
fertile mines only afford any considerable rent”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 197; Garnier,] l.c., p.  361).</p>
<p>There can only be a differential rent here.</p>
<p class="quote">“As the price, both of the precious
metals and of the precious stones, is regulated all over the
world by their price at the most fertile mine in it, the
rent which a mine of either can afford to its proprietor is
in proportion, not to its <em>absolute</em>, but to what may
be called its <em>relative</em> fertility, or to its
superiority over other mines of the same kind.  If new
mines were discovered as much superior to those of Potosi as
they were superior to those of Europe, the value of silver
might be so much degraded as to render even the mines of
Potosi not worth the working” ([O.U.P., Vol. 1,
p. 197; Garnier,] l.c., p. 362).</p>
<p>The products of the less fertile precious metal and
precious stone mines carry no rent, because it is
<em>always</em> the most fertile mine which determines
market-value and ever more fertile new mines are being
opened up—the line is always in the ascending
direction, Hence they are sold <em>below</em> their value,
merely at their cost-price.</p>
<p class="quote">“A produce, of which the value is
principally derived from its scarcity, is necessarily
degraded by its abundance” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 198;
Garnier,] l.c., p. 363).</p>
<p>Then Adam Smith’s argument again goes somewhat wrong.</p>
<p class="quote">“It is otherwise in estates above
ground.  The value, both of their produce and of their
rent, is in proportion to their <em>absolute</em>, and not to
their <em>relative</em> fertility.  The land which
produces a certain quantity of food, clothes, and lodging,
can always feed, clothe, and lodge a certain number of
people; and <em>whatever may be the proportion of the
landlord</em>” (the very question is whether he takes
any share of the produce, and in what proportion) <span class="context">||632|</span> “it will always give him
a proportionable command of the labour of those people, and
of the commodities with which that labour can supply
him” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 198; Garnier,] l.c.,
pp. 363-64).</p>
<p class="quote">“The value of the most barren lands
is not diminished by the neighbourhood of the most
fertile.  On the contrary, it is generally increased by
it.  The great number of people maintained by the
fertile lands <em>afford a market to many parts of the
produce of the barren</em>, which they could never have found
among those whom their own produce could
maintain.”</p>
<p>(But only if it does <em>not</em> produce <em>the same
product</em> as the fertile lands in its neighbourhood; only
if this product of the barren lands <em>does not compete</em>
with that of the more fertile.  In this case Adam Smith
is right and indeed, this is of importance to the way in
which the total amount of rent from different kinds of
natural products may increase in consequence of the
fertility of the land which yields food.)</p>
<p class="quote">“Whatever increases the fertility of
land in producing food, increases not only the value of the
lands upon which the improvement is bestowed” (it may
reduce this value and even destroy it), “but
contributes likewise to increase that of many other lands,
by creating a new demand for their produce” or,
<em>rather</em> by creating a demand for <em>new</em>
products.” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 198; Garnier,] l.c.,
p. 364.)</p>
<p>But in all this, Adam Smith does not offer any
explanation for absolute rent, which he presupposes to exist
for land that produces food.  He is correct when he
observes that it does not necessarily exist for other lands,
mines, for instance, because they are always available in
such <em>relatively</em> unlimited quantities (in comparison
with demand), that landed property cannot offer any
resistance to capital [so that] even if it exists in a legal
sense, it does not exist in the economic sense.</p>
<p>(See <em>p. 641</em> on <em>house rent</em>.)  <span class="context">|632||</span></p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||641|</span> See p. 632.  On
<em>house rent Adam Smith</em> says:</p>
<p class="quote">“Whatever part of the whole rent of a
house is <em>over and above what is sufficient</em> for
affording this reasonable <em>profit</em>” (to the
builder) “naturally goes to the ground-rent; and where
the owner of the ground, and the owner of the building, are
two different persons, it is in most cases, completely paid
to the former.  In country houses, at a distance from
any great town, where there is a plentiful choice of ground,
the ground-rent is scarcely any thing, or no more than what
the space upon which the house stands, would pay employed in
agriculture.” (Book V, Chapter II.)</p>
<p>In the case of the ground-rent of houses,
<em>situation</em> constitutes just as decisive a factor for
the differential rent, as fertility (and situation) in the
case of agricultural rent.</p>
<p>Adam Smith shares with the Physiocrats, not only the
partiality for agriculture and the landlord, but also the
view that they are particularly suitable objects of
taxation.  He says:</p>
<p class="quote">“Both ground-rents, and the ordinary
rent of land, are a species of revenue, which the owner in
many cases enjoys, without any care or attention of his
own.  Though a part of this revenue should be taken
from him, in order to defray the expenses of the State, no
discouragement will thereby be given to any sort of
industry.  The annual produce of the land and labour of
the society, the real wealth and revenue of the great body
of the people, might be the same after such a tax as
before.  Ground-rents, and the ordinary rent of land
are, therefore, perhaps, the species of revenue, which can
best bear to have a peculiar tax imposed upon them”
(Book V, Ch. II).</p>
<p>The considerations which Ricardo (p. 230) advances
against Adam Smith’s views on the subject, are very
philistine.  <span class="context">|641||</span><a name="s4"> </a></p>
<h3>[4.  Adam Smith’s Analysis of the Variations in the
Prices of Products of the Land]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||632|</span> “<em>Part
III</em>, <em>Of the variations in the Proportion between the
respective Values of that sort of Produce which always
affords Rent, and of that which sometimes does, and
sometimes does not, afford Rent</em>.” ([Garnier,] Book
I, Vol. II, Ch. XI.)</p>
<p class="quote">“In a country naturally fertile, but
of which the far greater part is altogether uncultivated,
cattle, poultry, game of all kinds, etc., <em>as they can be
acquired with a very small quantity of labour, so they will
purchase or command but a very small quantity</em>.”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 212; Garnier,] Vol. II, p. 25.)</p>
<p>The <em>peculiar</em> manner in which Adam Smith mixes up
the measuring of value by the quantity of labour, with the
price of labour or the quantity of labour which a commodity
can command, is evident from the above quotation, and
especially from the following passage, which also shows how
it has come about that at times he elevates corn to the
measure of value.</p>
<p class="quote">“In every state of society, in every
stage of improvement, <em>corn is the production of human
industry</em>.  But the average produce of every sort of
industry is always suited, more or less exactly, to the
average consumption; the average supply to the average
demand.  <em>In every different stage of
improvement</em>, besides, <em>the raising</em> of equal
quantities of corn in the same soil and climate, will, at an
average, <em>require</em> nearly <em>equal quantities of
labour; or</em>, what comes to the same thing, <em>the price
of nearly equal quantities;</em> the continual increase of
the productive powers of labour, in an improved state of
cultivation, being more or less counterbalanced by the
<em>continual</em> increasing <em>price of cattle</em>, the
<em>principal instruments</em> of agriculture.  Upon all
these accounts, therefore, we may rest assured, that
<em>equal quantities of corn</em> will <em>in every state of
society</em>, in every state of improvement, more nearly
<em>represent, or be equivalent to, equal quantities of
labour</em>, than equal quantities of any other part of the
rude produce of land.  Corn, accordingly … is,
in all the different stages of wealth and improvement, a
more accurate measure of value than any other commodity or
set of commodities…  <em>Corn</em>, besides, or
whatever else is the common and favourite vegetable food of
the people, constitutes, in every civilised country, the
<em>principal part of the subsistence of the
labourer</em>…  The money price of labour,
therefore, depends much more upon the average money price of
corn, the subsistence of the labour, than upon that of
butcher’s meat, or of any other part of the rude produce of
land.  The real value of gold and silver, therefore,
the real quantity of labour which they can purchase or
command, depends much more upon the quantity of corn which
they can purchase or command, than upon that of butcher’s
meat, or any other part of the rude produce of land”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 213-14; Garnier,] l.c.,
pp. 26-28).</p>
<p>When comparing the value of gold and silver, Adam Smith
once more sets forth his views on the sufficient price and
notes <span class="context">||633|</span> expressly that
<em>it excludes rent:</em></p>
<p class="quote">“A commodity may be said to be
<em>dear</em> or <em>cheap</em> not only according to the
absolute greatness or smallness of its usual price, but
according as that price is more or less above the lowest for
which it is possible to bring it to market for any
considerable time together.  <em>This lowest price is
that which barely replaces, with a moderate profit, the
stock which must be employed in bringing the commodity
thither.  It is the price which affords nothing to the
landlord, of which rent makes not any component part, but
which resolves itself altogether into wages and
profit</em>” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 243; Garnier,]
Vol. II, p. 81).</p>
<p class="quote">“The price of diamonds and other
precious stones may, perhaps, be still nearer to the lowest
price at which it is possible to bring them to market, than
even the price of gold” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 244;
Garnier,] Vol.  II, p. 83).</p>
<p>There are three sorts of raw products ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
p. 248; Garnier,] Vol. II, p. 89).  The <em>first</em>,
whose increase is almost, or entirely, independent of human
industry; the <em>second</em>, which can be increased in
proportion to the demand; the <em>third</em>, upon whose
increase human industry only exercises a “limited or
uncertain” influence.</p>
<p><em>First sort:</em> Fishes, rare birds, different sorts of
game, almost all wild-fowl, in particular the birds of
passage, etc.  The demand for these increases greatly
with wealth and luxury.</p>
<p class="quote">“The quantity of such commodities,
therefore, remaining the same, or nearly the same, while the
competition to purchase them is continually increasing,
their price may rise to any degree of extravagance”
([O.U.P., Vol.  I, pp. 248-49; Garnier,] Vol. II,
p. 91).</p>
<p class="quote"><em>Second sort:</em> “It consists in those useful
plants and animals, which, in uncultivated countries, nature
produces with such profuse abundance, that they are of
little or no value, and which, as cultivation advances, are
therefore forced to give place to some more profitable
produce.  During a long period in the progress of
improvement, the quantity of these is continually
diminishing, while, at the same time, the demand for them is
continually increasing.  Their real value, therefore,
the real quantity of labour which they will purchase or
command, gradually rises, till at last it gets so high as to
render them as profitable a produce as any thing else which
human industry can raise upon the most fertile and best
cultivated land.  When it has got so high, it cannot
well go higher.  If it did, more land and more industry
would soon be employed to increase their quantity”
([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 250-51; Garnier,] Vol. II,
pp. 94-95).  So, for instance, with cattle.</p>
<p class="quote">“Of all the different substances,
however, which compose this second sort of rude produce,
cattle is, perhaps, that of which the price, in the progress
of improvement, rises first to this height” ([O.U.P.,
Vol. I, p.  252; Garnier,] Vol. II, pp. 96-97). 
“As cattle are among the first, so perhaps
<em>venison</em> is among the last parts of this sort of rude
produce which bring this price” (i.e., that price
which makes it worth while cultivating the soil in order to
feed them).  “The price of venison in Great
Britain, how extravagant soever it may appear, is not near
sufficient to compensate the expense of a deer park, as is
well known to all those who have had any experience in the
feeding of deer” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 256; Garnier,]
Vol. II, p. 104).</p>
<p class="quote">“Thus, in every farm, the offals of
the barn and stable will maintain a certain number of
<em>poultry</em>.  These, as they are fed with what would
otherwise be lost, are a mere save-all; and as they cost the
farmer scarce any thing, so he can afford to sell them for
very little.” While this supply is sufficient, poultry
[is] as cheap as butcher’s meat.  With the growth of
wealth, the demand grows, and consequently the price of
poultry [rises] <em>above</em> that of butcher’s meat, until
“it becomes profitable to cultivate land for the sake
of feeding them” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p.  257; Garnier,]
Vol. II, pp. 105-06).  Thus in <em>France</em>, etc.</p>
<p class="quote">The <em>hog</em>, like poultry, is “originally kept
as a save-all.” It lives on refuse.  In the end
the price rises until land must be cultivated specifically
for its food ([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 258-59; Garnier,]
Vol. II, pp.  108-09).</p>
<p class="quote"><em>Milk</em>, dairy farming ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 259,
et. seq.; Garnier,] Vol. II, p. 110, et. seq.). 
(Butter, cheese ibid.)</p>
<p>According to Adam Smith, the gradual rise in the
<em>price</em> of these raw products only proves that, little
by little, they are becoming <em>products of human
industry</em>, while previously, they were practically only
<em>products of nature</em>.  Their transformation from
products of nature into products of industry is itself the
result of the advance of cultivation, which is increasingly
limiting the scope of the spontaneous productions of
nature.  On the other hand, under less developed
conditions of production, a large part of these products was
sold <em>below its value</em>.  The commodities are sold
<em>at</em> their value (hence the rise in prices), as soon as
they cease to be a by-product and become an independent
product of some branch of agriculture.</p>
<p class="quote">“The lands of no country, it is
evident, can ever be completely cultivated and improved,
till once the <em>price</em> of every produce, which human
industry is obliged to raise upon them, has got so high as
<em>to pay for the expense of complete improvement and
cultivation</em>.  In order to do this, the price of
each particular produce must be sufficient, first, to pay
the rent of good corn land, as it is that which regulates
the rent of the greater part of other cultivated land; and,
secondly, to pay the labour and expense of the farmer as
well as they are commonly paid upon good corn land; or, in
other words, <em>to replace with the ordinary profits the
stock which he employs about it</em>.  This <em>rise in
the price</em> of each particular produce must evidently
<span class="context">||634|</span> <em>be previous to</em>
the improvement and cultivation of the land which is
destined for raising it” “… those
different sorts of rude produce … <em>have become
worth</em>, not only a greater quantity of silver, but a
greater quantity of labour and subsistence than
before.  As it <em>costs a greater quantity of labour
and subsistence to bring them to market</em>, so, when they
are <em>brought thither</em>, they <em>represent or are
equivalent to a greater quantity</em>” ([O.U.P.,
Vol. I, pp. 261-62; Garnier,] Vol. II, pp. 113-15).</p>
<p>Here it is once more evident, how Smith is only able to
use value as determined by the quantity of labour it [value]
can buy, in so far as he confuses it with value as
determined by the quantity of labour required for the
production of the commodities.</p>
<p><em>Third sort:</em> This is the raw product,</p>
<p class="quote">“in which the efficacy of human
industry, in augmenting the quantity, is either limited or
uncertain” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 262; Garnier,] Vol.
II, p. 115).</p>
<p><em>Wool</em> and <em>raw hides</em> are limited by the
number of large and small cattle that are kept.  But
the first <em>by-products</em> already have a <em>large
market</em>, while the animal itself does not yet have
this.  The market for butcher’s meat is almost always
confined to the inland market.  Wool and raw hides,
even in the rude beginnings [of cultivation], are in most
cases already sold in foreign markets.  They are easily
transported and furnish the raw material of many
manufactured goods.  They may thus find a market in
countries which are more developed industrially when the
industry in the country where they are produced does not yet
require them.</p>
<p class="quote">“In countries ill cultivated, and
therefore but thinly inhabited, the price of the wool and
the hide bears always a much greater proportion to that of
the whole beast, than in countries where, improvement and
population being further advanced, there is more demand for
butcher’s meat.” The same applies to
“tallow”, In the progress of industry and
population, the rise in price of cattle affects the
<em>carcase</em> more than the <em>wool</em> or
<em>hide</em>.  For with the increase in industry and
population of a country, the market for meat expands,
whereas that for the by-products already previously extended
beyond the boundaries of the country.  But with the
development of industry in the country itself, the price for
wool, etc., will nevertheless also rise somewhat. 
([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 263-64; Garnier,] Vol.  II,
pp. 115-19).</p>
<p class="quote"><em>Fish</em>.  ([Garnier,] Vol. II,
pp. 129-30.)  If the demand for fish rises, then its
supply requires more labour.  “The fish must
generally be sought for at a greater distance, larger
vessels must be employed, and more expensive machinery of
every kind made use of.” “.., it will generally
be impossible to supply the … extended market,
without employing a quantity of labour greater than in
proportion to what had been requisite for supplying the
narrow and confined one.” “The <em>real price</em>
of this commodity, therefore, naturally rises in the
progress of improvement” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 270;
Garnier,] Vol.  II, p. 130).</p>
<p>Here Adam Smith therefore determines the <em>real
price</em> by the quantity of labour necessary for the
production of the commodity.</p>
<p>According to Adam Smith, the <em>real price</em> of
<em>vegetable food</em> (corn, etc.) must <em>fall</em> in the
course of civilisation.</p>
<p class="quote">“The extension of improvement and
cultivation, as it <em>necessarily raises</em> more or less,
in proportion to the price of corn, <em>that of every sort of
animal food</em>, so it as necessarily <em>lowers</em> that of,
I believe, every sort of <em>vegetable food</em>.  It
raises the price of animal food; because a great part of the
land which produces it, being rendered <em>fit</em> for
producing corn, must afford to the landlord and farmer the
rent and profit of corn land.  It <em>lowers the price
of vegetable food;</em> because, <em>by increasing the
fertility of the land</em>, it increases its abundance. 
The improvements of agriculture, too, introduce many sorts
of vegetable food, which requiring less land, and not more
labour than corn, come much cheaper to market.  Such
are potatoes and maize…  Many sorts of vegetable
food, besides, which in the rude state of agriculture are
confined to the kitchen garden, and raised only by the
spade, come, in its improved state, to be introduced into
common fields, and to be raised by the plough; such as
turnips, carrots, cabbages, etc.” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
pp. 278-79; Garnier,] Vol. II, pp. 145-46).</p>
<p>Adam Smith sees that the <em>price of manufactured
commodities</em> in general has fallen wherever</p>
<p class="quote">“the real price of the <em>rude
materials</em> either does not rise at all, or does not rise
very much” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 280; Garnier,]
p. 149).</p>
<p>On the other hand, he asserts that the real price of
labour, i.e., wages, has risen with the progress in
production.  Hence also, according to him, the prices
of commodities do not necessarily rise because of a rise in
wages, or the price of labour, although wages [form]
“a component part of the natural price” and even
of the “sufficient price” or the “lowest
price at which commodities can be brought to
market”.  So how does Adam Smith explain
this?  By a fall in profits?  No.  (Although
he assumes that the general rate of profit falls in the
course of civilisation.)  Or of rent?  No
again.  He says:</p>
<p class="quote">“In consequence of better machinery,
<span class="context">||635|</span> of greater dexterity,
and of a more proper division and distribution of work, all
of which are the natural effects of improvement, a <em>much
smaller quantity of labour becomes requisite</em> for
executing <em>any particular piece of work;</em> and though,
in consequence of the <em>flourishing circumstances</em> of
society, the <em>real price of labour should rise</em> very
considerably, yet <em>the great diminution of the
quantity,” requisite for each particular article</em><a href="#-ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[c]</a>, “will
generally much more than compensate the greatest rise which
can happen in the price.” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 280;
Garnier,] Vol. II, p. 148.)</p>
<p>Thus the <em>value</em> of the commodities falls, because a
smaller quantity of labour is required to produce them; the
value moreover falls although the <em>real price</em> of
labour rises.  If here the <em>real price</em> of labour
means the <em>value</em> [of labour], then the profit must
fall, <em>if</em> the price of the commodity falls as a result
of the fall in its value.  <em>If</em>, on the other
hand, it means the quantity of the means of subsistence
received by the worker, then the Smithian thesis is correct
even where profit is rising.</p>
<p>The extent to which Adam Smith uses the correct
definition of value, wherever he actually analyses [facts]
can be seen at the end of the chapter where he examines why
<em>woollen cloths</em> were dearer in the 16th century,
etc.</p>
<p class="quote">“It <em>cost a greater quantity of
labour to bring the goods to market</em>.  When they
were brought thither, therefore, they must have purchased,
or exchanged for the <em>price</em> of, a greater
quantity” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, p. 284; Garnier,] Vol. II,
p. 156).</p>
<p>The mistake here consists only in the use of the word
<em>price</em>.<a name="s5"> </a></p>
<h3>[5.  Adam Smith’s Views on the Movements of Rent and
His Estimation of the Interests of the Various Social
Classes]</h3>
<p><em>Conclusion of the Chapter</em>.  Adam Smith
concludes his chapter on rent with the observation that</p>
<p class="quote">“every improvement in the
circumstances of the society tends, either directly or
indirectly, to raise the real rent of land.”</p>
<p class="quote">“The extension of improvement and
cultivation tends to raise it directly.  The landlord’s
share of the produce necessarily increases with the increase
of the produce.” The “rise in the real price of
those parts of the rude produce of land, which is first the
effect of the extended improvement and cultivation, and
afterwards the cause of their being still further
extended” for instance the rise in the price of
cattle, raises, firstly, the real value of the landlord’s
share, but also the proportion of that share, because:
“That produce, after the rise in its real price,
<em>requires no more labour to</em> collect <em>it than
before</em>.  A <em>smaller proportion of it will</em>,
therefore, <em>be sufficient to replace, with the ordinary
profit, the stock which employs that labour</em>.  A
greater proportion of it must consequently belong to the
landlord” ([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 285-86; Garnier,]
Vol. II, pp. 158-59).</p>
<p>In exactly the same way Ricardo explains the increase in
the proportion of rent, as the price of corn rises on the
more fertile land, only this rise in price is not the result
of improvement, and therefore leads Ricardo to the opposite
conclusion from Adam Smith.</p>
<p>Adam Smith says that the landlord moreover benefits from
every development of the productive power of labour in
manufacture.</p>
<p class="quote">“Whatever reduces the real price of
the latter” [i.e., manufactured goods] “raises
that of the former” [i.e., of agricultural
produce].  Furthermore, with every increase of the real
wealth of the society, the population increases; with the
population increases the demand for agricultural produce and
consequently the capital employed in agriculture; “and
the rent increases with the produce”.  On the
other hand all circumstances which hinder the growth of
general wealth, will have the opposite effect and lead to a
fall in rent and hence a decrease in the real wealth of the
landowners ([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 286-87; Garnier,] Vol. II,
pp. 159-60).</p>
<p>From this Adam Smith concludes that the interests of the
landlord are always in harmony with the “general
interest of society”.  This also applies to the
<em>labourers</em> ([O.U.P., Vol. I, pp. 287-88; Garnier,]
Vol. II, pp.  161-62).  But Adam Smith is honest enough
to make the following distinction:</p>
<p class="quote">“The order of proprietors may perhaps
gain more by the prosperity of the society than that of
labourers; but there is no order that suffers so cruelly
from its” [society’s] “decline” [as do the
labourers] ([O.U.P., Vol. p.  288; Garnier,] Vol. II,
p. 162).</p>
<p>The interests of the capitalists (manufacturers and
merchants), on the other hand, are not identical with
the</p>
<p class="quote">“general interest of the
society… ” “The interest of the
dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade or
manufactures, is <em>always</em> in some respects
<em>different</em> from, and even <em>opposite</em> to, that of
the public.” [The dealers are]…  an order
of men, whose interest <span class="context">||636|</span>
is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have
generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the
public, and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both
deceived and oppressed it” ([O.U.P., Vol. I,
pp. 289-90; Garnier,] Vol. II, pp. 163-65).  <span class="context">|636||</span> .</p>
