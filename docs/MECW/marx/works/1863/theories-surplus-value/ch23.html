<p><span class="context">||1102|</span> Cherbuliez,

Geneva edition) [published under the title <em>Riche ou
pauvre</em>].</p>
<p>(It is questionable whether we should specially include
this fellow in this group [of economists] since most of
what he writes is based on Sismondi, or whether we should on
occasion insert his pertinent remarks in the form of
quotations.  <span class="context">|1102||</span></p>
<h3>[1.  Distinction Between Two Parts of
Capital—the Part Consisting of Machinery and Raw
Materials and the Part Consisting of “Means of
Subsistence” for the Workers]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||1103|</span> Capital, says
Cherbuliez, consists of “the raw materials, the tools,
the means of subsistence” (op. cit., p. 16). 
“There is no difference between a capital and any
other part of wealth.  It is only the way in which it
is employed which determines whether a thing becomes
capital, that is, if it is employed in a <em>production</em>
as raw material, as tools, or as means of subsistence”
(loc. cit., p. 18).</p>
<p>This is the standard way of reducing capital to the
material elements in which it presents itself in the labour
process, i.e., means of production and means of
subsistence.  The latter category, moreover, is not
accurate since, though means of subsistence are indeed a
condition for the producer, a prerequisite enabling him to
exist during production, they themselves do not enter into
the labour process, into which nothing enters but the object
of labour, the means of production and labour itself. 
Thus the objective factors of the labour process—which
are common to all forms of production—are here called
<em>capital</em>, although the <em>means of subsistence</em> (in
which wages are already included) tacitly implies the
<em>capitalist</em> form of these conditions of
production.


<p><a name="tsv3p363">Cherbuliez</a>, like Ramsay, [assumes] that the <em>means of
subsistence</em>—which Ramsay calls circulating
capital—diminish (relatively, at any rate, to the
total amount of capital and absolutely insofar as machinery
continually throws workers out of employment).  But
both he and Ramsay appear to think that there is an
inevitable reduction in the amount of means of subsistence,
of necessaries, which can be employed as productive
capital.  But this is by no means the case.  In
this context, people always confuse that part of the gross
product which replaces capital and is employed as capital,
with that part which represents the surplus product. 
The means of subsistence decrease because a large portion of
capital, that is, the part of the gross product employed as
capital, is reproduced as constant capital instead of as
variable capital.  A larger portion of the surplus
product, consisting of means of subsistence, is consumed by
unproductive workers or idlers or exchanged for
luxuries.  That’s all.</p>
<p>True, the fact that a constantly smaller part of the
total capital is converted into variable capital can also be
expressed in other ways.  The part of capital which
consists of variable capital is equal to that part of the
total product which the worker himself appropriates,
produces for himself.  Therefore, the smaller this part
is the smaller accordingly is the portion of the total
number of workers which is required to reproduce it (just as
in the case of the individual worker, who works
correspondingly less labour-time for himself).  The
total product, like the total labour of the workers, falls
into two parts.  One part the workers produce for
themselves; the other part, they produce for the
capitalist.  Just as the [labour-] time of the
individual worker can be divided into two parts, so can the
[labour-] time of the whole working class.  If the
surplus labour is equal to half a day, it is the same as if
half the working class produces means of subsistence for the
working class and the other half produces raw materials,
machinery and finished products for the capitalists, partly
as producers and partly as consumers.</p>
<p>It is ridiculous that Cherbuliez and Ramsay believe that
the part of the gross product which can be consumed by the
workers and can enter into their consumption in kind has
been reduced of necessity or reduced at all.  Only that
part has been reduced which is consumed in this form and
therefore as <em>variable capital</em>.  On the other
hand, a larger portion is eaten up by servants, soldiers,
etc., or exported and exchanged for more sumptuous means of
subsistence.


<p><a name="tsv3p364">The</a> only important thing in both Ramsay and Cherbuliez is
that they counterpose <em>constant</em> and <em>variable
capital</em> and do not confine themselves to the distinction
between fixed and circulating capital derived from
circulation.  For Cherbuliez counterposes that part of
capital which goes on means of subsistence to that which
consists of raw materials, auxiliary materials and means of
labour, i.e., instruments, machines.  Although two
constituent elements of constant capital—raw material
and auxiliary material—belong to circulating capital
as far as the mode of circulation is concerned.</p>
<p>The important thing in variations in the constituent
elements of capital is not that relatively more workers are
occupied in the production of raw materials and machinery
than in that of direct means of subsistence—this
concerns only the division of labour— but the
proportion of the product which has to be used to replace
past labour (i.e., to replace constant capital) to that
which has to be used to pay living labour.  The larger
the scale of capitalist production, and hence the greater
the accumulation of capital—the greater is the share
in the value of the product falling to the machinery and raw
material of which the capital employed in the production of
machinery and raw material consists.  A correspondingly
larger portion of the product must therefore be returned to
production either in kind or by the producers of constant
capital exchanging some of their products amongst
themselves.  The part of the product which belongs to
production becomes larger, and the part which represents
living, newly added labour becomes relatively smaller. 
Although, this part grows in terms of
commodities—use-values—the development described
is synonymous with increased productivity of labour. 
But the portion of this part which the worker receives falls
relatively all the more.  And the same process gives
rise to a continuous relative redundancy of the working
population.</p>
<h3>[2.  On the Progressive Decline in the Number of
Workers in Relation to the Amount of Constant Capital]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||1104|</span> &lt;It is an
incontrovertible fact that, as capitalist production
develops, the portion of capital invested in machinery and
raw materials grows, and the portion laid out in wages
declines.  This is the only question with which both
Ramsay and Cherbuliez are concerned.  For us, however,
the main thing is:
<a name="tsv3p365">does</a> this fact explain the decline in the rate of
profit?  (A decline, incidentally, which is far smaller
than it is said to be.)  Here it is not simply a
question of the quantitative ratio but of the <em>value
ratio</em>.</p>
<p>If one worker can spin as much cotton as 100 [workers
spun previously], then the supply of raw material must be
increased a hundredfold, and this is moreover brought about
only by the spinning-machine which enables one worker to
control 100 spindles.  But if simultaneously, one
worker produces as much cotton as 100 workers did previously
and one worker produces a spinning-machine whereas
previously he produced only a spindle, then the ratio of
value remains the same, that is, the labour expended in the
spinning, [in the production of] the cotton and the
spinning-machine remains the same as that expended
previously in spinning, the cotton and the spindle.</p>
<p>As far as the <em>machinery</em> is concerned, its cost is
not as great as that of the labour it displaces, although
the spinning-machine is much more expensive than the
spindle.  The individual capitalist who owns a
spinning-machine must possess a greater amount of capital
than the individual spinner who buys a spinning-wheel. 
But the spinning-machine is cheaper than the spinning-wheel
in relation to the number of workers it employs. 
Otherwise it would not have displaced the
spinning-wheel.  The place of the spinner is taken by a
capitalist.  But the capital which the former laid out
on the spinning-wheel was <em>larger</em> relative to the size
of the product, than that which the capitalist lays out on
the spinning-machine.&gt;</p>
<p>The increasing productivity of labour (insofar as it is
connected with machinery) is identical with the decreasing
number of workers relatively to the number and extent of the
machinery employed.  Instead of a simple and cheap
instrument a collection of such instruments (even though
they are modified) is used, and to that collection has to be
added the whole part of the machinery which consists of the
moving and transmitting parts; and also the materials used
(like coal, etc.)  to produce the motive power (such as
steam).  Finally, the buildings.  If one worker is
in charge of 1,800 spindles instead of driving a
spinning-wheel, it would be quite ridiculous to ask why
these 1,800 spindles are not as cheap as the single
spinning-wheel.  The productivity in this case is
brought about precisely by the amount of capital employed as
machinery.  The ratio of the wear and tear of the
machinery affects only the commodity; the worker confronts
the total amount
<a name="tsv3p366">of</a> machinery and similarly the value of the capital laid
out in labour confronts the value of the capital laid out in
machinery.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that machinery becomes cheaper, and
this for two reasons: [1] The application of machinery to
the production of raw materials from which the machinery is
made.  [2] The application of machinery in the
transformation of these materials into machinery.  In
saying this, we already say two things. 
<em>Firstly</em>, that in both these branches, compared with
the instruments required in the manufacturing industry, the
value of the capital laid out in machinery also grows as
compared with that laid out in wages.  <em>Secondly</em>,
what becomes cheaper is the individual machine and its
component parts, but a system of machinery develops; the
tool is not simply replaced by a single machine, but by a
whole system, and the tools which perhaps played the major
part previously, the needle for example (in the case of a
stocking-loom or a similar machine), are now assembled in
thousands.  Each individual machine confronting the
worker is in itself a colossal assembly of instruments which
he formerly used singly, e.g. 1,800 spindles instead of
one.  But in addition, the machine contains elements
which the old instrument did not have.  Despite the
cheapening of individual elements, the price of the whole
aggregate increases enormously and the [increase in]
productivity consists in the continuous expansion of the
machinery.</p>
<p>Further, one factor in the cheapening of machinery apart
from that of its elements, is the cheapening of the source
of the motive power (the steam-boiler, for example) and of
the transmission mechanism.  Economy of power. 
But this results precisely from the fact that to an
increasing extent the same motor can drive a larger system
of machines.  The motor becomes relatively cheaper (or
its cost does not grow in the same ratio as the increase in
the size of the system in which it is employed; the motor
becomes more expensive as its power grows, but not in the
same degree in which it grows); even when its cost increases
absolutely, it declines relatively.  This is therefore
a new and important motive, quite apart from the price of
the individual machine, for increasing the capital that is
laid out in machinery and confronts labour.  One
element—the increasing speed of
machinery—increases productivity enormously but it
does not affect the value of the machinery itself in any
way.</p>
<p>It is therefore self-evident or a tautological
proposition that the increasing productivity of labour
caused by machinery corresponds
<a name="tsv3p367">to</a> increased value of the machinery relative to
the amount of labour employed (consequently to the value of
labour, the variable capital).</p>
<p><span class="context">||1105|</span> All circumstances
which result in the use of machinery leading to a reduction
in the price of commodities can be attributed, firstly, to a
decrease in the amount of labour embodied in each individual
commodity, secondly, however, to a decrease in the wear and
tear of the machinery whose value enters into the individual
commodity.  The less rapid the wear and tear of the
machinery, the less labour is required for its
reproduction.  This therefore increases the amount and
the value of the capital existing as machinery as compared
with that existing in labour.</p>
<p>Only the question of raw material therefore remains to be
dealt with.  It is obvious that the quantity of raw
material must increase proportionally with the productivity
of labour; that is, the amount of raw material must be
proportionate to that of labour.  This relationship is
closer than it appears.</p>
<p>Let us assume, for example, that 10,000 lbs. of cotton
are consumed weekly.  Calculating 50 weeks to the year,
this would amount to 10,000×50, that is, 500,000 lbs. 
Let us also assume that the amount paid out in wages is
£5,000 over the year.  And if a pound of cotton is
assumed to cost 6d. this comes to 250,000 shillings or
£12,500.  Let us assume that the capital turns over 5
times during the year.  This means that in the course
of a fifth of a year, 100,000 pounds of raw
material—cotton—is used, equal to a value of
£2,500.  And £1,000 goes on wages in the same fifth of
a year.  This is more than a third of the value of the
capital laid out on the cotton.  This does not alter
the ratio.  If the value of the cotton amounts to
£10,000 every fifth of a year and that of the labour to
£1,000, then it amounts to one-tenth.  (If one
considers the product of the whole year, £50,000 on one side
and £5,000 on the other—it is also one-tenth.)</p>
<p>&lt;The value of a commodity, as far as machinery is
concerned, is determined by the wear and tear of the
machinery, that is, solely by the value of the machinery
insofar as it enters into the process of the formation of
value, in other words, insofar as it is used up in the
labour process.  Profit, on the contrary, is determined
(leaving raw materials out of account) by the value of the
whole of the machinery which enters into the labour process
irrespective of the degree to which it is used up. 
Profit must therefore decline as the total amount of labour
employed declines compared with the part of capital laid out
in machinery.  It does
<a name="tsv3p368">not</a> decline in the same proportion because surplus labour
increases.&gt;</p>
<p>One may ask with regard to raw material: If, for example,
productivity in spinning increases tenfold, that is, a
single worker spins as much as ten did previously, why
should not one Negro produce ten times as much cotton as ten
did previously, that is, why should the <em>value ratio</em>
not remain the same?  The spinner uses ten times as
much cotton in the same time, but the Negro produces ten
times as much cotton in the same time.  The ten times
larger amount of cotton therefore costs no more than a tenth
of this amount cost previously.  This means that
despite the increase in the amount of the raw material, its
value ratio to variable capital remains the same.  In
fact it was only the large fall in the price of cotton which
enabled the cotton industry to develop in the way it did.<a href="#-ftn1" name="_ftnref1">*</a> The dearer the material (gold and silver, for
example) the less are machinery and the division of labour
applied in transforming it into articles of luxury. 
This is because too much capital has been advanced for the
raw materials and the demand for these products is limited
owing to the expensive raw materials.</p>
<p>To this it is quite easy to answer that some kinds of raw
materials, such as wool, silk, leather, are produced by
animal <em>organic</em> processes, while <em>cotton, linen</em>,
etc., are produced by vegetable organic processes and
capitalist production has not yet succeeded, and never will
succeed in mastering these processes in the same way as it
has mastered purely mechanical or inorganic chemical
processes.  Raw materials such as skins, etc., and
other animal products become dearer partly because the
insipid law of rent increases the value of these products as
civilisation advances.  As far as coal and metal (wood)
are concerned, they become much cheaper with the advance of
production; this will however become more difficult as mines
are exhausted, etc.</p>
<p>&lt;While it can be said with regard to corn-rent and
mine-rent that they do not increase the value of the product
(only its market price) but are rather the expression of the
value of the product (the excess of its value <em>over</em>
the production price), there is, on the other hand, no doubt
that animal rent, house rent, etc., are not consequences but
<em>causes</em> of the increasing values of these
things.&gt;


<p><a name="tsv3p369">The</a> cheapening of raw materials, and of auxiliary
materials; etc., checks but does not cancel the growth in
the value of this part of capital.  It checks it to the
degree that it brings about a fall in profit.</p>
<p>This rubbish is herewith disposed of <span class="context">|1105||</span> .</p>
<p><span class="context">||1105|</span> &lt;In considering
profit, surplus-value is assumed as given.  And only
the variations in constant capital and their influence on
the rate of profit are considered.  There is only one
way in which surplus-value directly affects constant
capital, namely through <em>absolute surplus labour</em>,
lengthening of the working-day, as a result of which the
relative value of constant capital is reduced. 
Relative surplus labour—where the working-day remains
unaltered (apart from the greater intensification of
labour)—in-creases the value ratio of profit to total
capital by increasing the surplus itself.  Absolute
surplus labour-time reduces the cost of constant capital
relatively.&gt;</p>
<h3>[3.  Cherbuliez’s Inkling that the Organic
Composition of Capital Is Decisive for the Rate of
Profit.  His Confusion on This Question. 
Cherbuliez on the “Law of Appropriation” in
Capitalist Economy]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||1106|</span> Let us return to
Cherbuliez.</p>
<p>The formulas he uses for the rate of profit are either
mathematical expressions for profit as it is commonly
understood, without involving any kind of law, or they are
quite wrong, although he has an <em>inkling</em> of the
matter, approaches close to it.</p>
<p class="quote">“… commercial profit is
determined by the <em>value of the products</em> compared with
the value of the <em>different elements</em> of productive
capital”[op. cit., p. 70].</p>
<p>&lt;In point of fact, profit is the relationship of the
surplus-value of the product to the value of the total
capital outlay regardless of the differences in its
elements.  But the surplus-value is itself determined
by the size of the variable capital and the rate at which it
produces surplus-value, and the <em>ratio</em> of this
surplus-value to the total capital is again determined by
the ratio of the variable to the constant capital and also
by changes in the value of constant capital.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“Evidently the two chief elements in
this determination are the price of the raw materials and
amount of means of subsistence required to work them up
[…] the economic progress of society affects these
two elements in an <em>opposite</em> way […] it tends
to make raw materials dearer by increasing
<a name="tsv3p370">the</a> value of all the products of the extractive
industries, which are carried out on land that is privately
owned and limited in extent” (loc. cit., p. 70). 
On the other hand, the means of subsistence decrease
(relatively), a matter to which we shall return
presently.</p>
<p class="quote">“The total amount of products, less
the total amount of capital expended in producing them,
provides us with the total amount of profit gained during a
definite period of time.  The <em>growth</em> in the
total amount of products <em>is proportionate to the capital
advanced</em> and not the capital used up.  The <em>rate
of pro/it</em>, or the ratio of profit to capital, is
therefore the result of the combination of two other ratios,
namely, the <em>ratio between the capital laid out and that
used up</em>, and the <em>ratio between the capital used up
and the product</em>” (loc. cit., p. 70).</p>
<p>Cherbuliez first states correctly that profit is
determined by the <em>value</em> of the product in relation to
the “different elements” of productive
capital.  Then he flies off suddenly to the product
itself, to the total amount of products.  But the
amount of products may increase without its value
increasing.  Secondly, a comparison between the amount
of the product and the quantity of products of which the
capital—used up and not used up—consisted, can
at best only be made in the way Ramsay does, by comparing
the aggregate national product with the constituent elements
expended in kind during its production.<a href="#-ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[a]</a> But as regards capital, the
form taken by the product is different from its ingredients
in every sphere of production (even in those branches of
industry in which, as in agriculture, one part of the
product is used in kind as a production element of the
product).  Why does Cherbuliez stray on to this false
path?  Because, despite his vague idea that the organic
composition of capital is decisive for the rate of profit,
he in no way uses the contradiction between variable capital
and the other part of capital in order to explain
surplus-value—which, like value itself, he does not
explain at all.  He has not shown how surplus-value
arises and therefore has recourse to <em>surplus product</em>,
i.e., to <em>use-value</em>.</p>
<p>Although all surplus-value takes the form of surplus
product, surplus product as such does not represent
surplus-value.  &lt;A product may contain no
surplus-value, as, for example, in the case of a peasant who
owns his own implements as well as his own land and only
works exactly the same amount of time as any wage-worker
does to reproduce his own wages, say six hours.  In a
good year, he might produce twice as much [as usual]. 
But the value would remain the same.  There would be no
surplus-value, although there would be surplus
product.&gt;


<p><a name="tsv3p371">In</a> itself it was already a mistake on the part of
Cherbuliez to represent variable capital in the
“passive” and purely material form of means of
subsistence, that is, as use-value, a form which it obtains
in the hands of the workers.  If, on the other hand, he
had considered it in the form in which it actually appears,
namely, as money (as the form in which exchange-value, i.e.,
a certain amount of social labour-time as such, exists),
then [he would have seen that] for the <em>capitalist</em> it
represents the labour which he exchanges for it (and, as a
result of this exchange of materialised labour for living
labour, the variable capital would be set in motion and
would grow); variable capital in the shape of
labour—but not if it is regarded as means of
subsistence—becomes an element of productive
capital.  Means of subsistence, on the other hand, are
the use-value, the material existence of the variable
capital when it becomes the revenue of the worker. 
Variable capital regarded as <em>means of subsistence</em> is,
therefore, just as “<em>passive</em>” an element
as both the other parts of capital which Cherbuliez
describes as “passive”.<a href="#-ftn3" name="_ftnref3">*</a></p>
<p>The same distortion of views prevents him from
elaborating the rate of profit out of the
<em>relationship</em> of this active element to the passive
element, and from showing that it declines as society
advances.  Cherbuliez in fact reaches no other
conclusion but that the means of subsistence <span class="context">||1107|</span> decline as a consequence of
the development of productivity while the working population
grows, that is, as a result of the redundant population,
wages are consequently pushed down below their value. 
None of his explanations are based on the exchange of
[equal] values—or the payment of labour-power at its
value—and profit thus <em>actually</em> appears to be a
<em>deduction from wages</em> (although he doesn’t say
so).  This deduction may indeed occasionally constitute
a part of real profits, but it can never serve as the
foundation for the elaboration of the category of
profit.</p>
<p>Let us first of all reduce the first proposition to its
correct formulation.</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>value</em> of the total amount
of products, less the <em>value</em> of the total amount of
capital used up in its production, provides us with the
total amount of profit gained during a definite period of
time.”</p>
<p>This is the primary (usual) form in which profit appears
and
<a name="tsv3p372">it</a> is likewise the form in which it appears in the
consciousness of capitalists.  In other words, [profit
is] the excess of the value of the product gained during a
definite period of time over the value of the capital
expended.  Or the excess of the value of the product
over the cost-price of the product.  Even the
“definite period of time” in Cherbuliez’s
statement appears like a bolt from the blue, since he has
not dealt with the circulation process of capital.  The
first proposition, therefore, is nothing but the usual
definition of profit, of the immediate form in which it
appears.</p>
<p><em>The second proposition:</em></p>
<p class="quote">“<em>The growth in the total amount of
products</em> is proportionate to the capital employed and
not to the capital used up.”</p>
<p>Paraphrased again, it would read thus:</p>
<p class="quote">“the <em>growth</em> in the
<em>value</em> of the total amount of products is
proportionate to the capital advanced” (whether used
up or not).</p>
<p>The only purpose of this is the <em>surreptitious
introduction</em> of the completely unproven and, in the way
it is formulated, quite false proposition (for it already
presupposes equalisation to the general rate of profit) that
the amount of profit depends on the amount of capital
employed.  But an apparent causal nexus is to be
introduced because “the <em>growth in the total amount
of products</em> is proportionate to the capital
<em>employed</em> and not to the capital used up”.</p>
<p>Let us take this sentence in both its
formulations—that in which it is written and that in
which it ought to have been written.  In this
context—and in accordance with the conclusion which it
is intended to serve as intermediate clause—it should
be written as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">“The <em>growth</em> in the
<em>value</em> of the total amount of products is
proportionate to the capital employed and not to the capital
used up.”</p>
<p>Here, evidently, surplus-value is to be evolved on the
basis of the fact that the excess of the capital employed
over that used up creates the <em>excess value of the
products</em>.  But the capital which is not used up
(machinery, etc.) retains its value (for the fact that
it is not used up means precisely that its value has not
been used up); it retains the same value after the
conclusion of the production process as it had before this
process started.  If <em>any change in value</em> has
taken place, it can only have happened in that part of the
capital which has been used up, and which therefore entered
into the process of the formation of value.  In
point
<a name="tsv3p373">of</a> fact it is also wrong to say that, for example, a
capital of which a third is not used up and two-thirds are
used up in production, would inevitably yield a higher
profit than one in which two-thirds are not used up and
one-third is used up, provided the <em>rate of exploitation
is the same</em> (and disregarding the equalisation of the
rate of profit).  For obviously, the second capital
contains more machinery, etc., and other elements of
constant capital, while the first capital contains less of
these elements and sets more living labour in motion, and
therefore produces more surplus labour as well.</p>
<p>If we take the proposition as formulated by Cherbuliez
himself, then it must be said first that it is of no use to
him, because the amount of products or the amount of
use-values as such by no means determines either the value
or the surplus-value or the profit.  But what is behind
all this?  A part of constant capital consisting of
machinery, etc., enters into the labour process without
entering into the formation of value, it helps to increase
the volume of products without adding anything to its
value.  (For insofar as its wear and tear adds value to
the product, it belongs to the capital <em>used up</em> and
not to the capital <em>employed</em> as opposed to that used
up.)  But, by itself, this unconsumed part of constant
capital does not bring about a <em>growth in the amount of
products</em>.  It helps to produce a greater output in
a given labour-time.  Therefore, if only the same
amount of labour-time were expended as is contained in the
means of subsistence, the same amount of products would be
produced.  The excess of products is therefore due to a
change which takes place in this part of the <em>capital used
up</em> and not to the excess of the capital employed over
that consumed (assuming that it is not a matter of branches
of industry in which—as in agriculture—the
<em>volume</em> of products is, or can be, independent of the
amount of capital laid out, [because] the productivity of
labour is, in part, dependent on uncontrollable natural
conditions).</p>
<p>If however he considers constant capital—used up or
otherwise—as independent of the labour-time,
independent of the change in the variable capital which
takes place in the realisation process, then he might just
as well say:</p>
<p class="quote">“The growth in the total amount <span class="context">||1108|</span> of products” (at beast
in manufacturing industry) “is proportionate to the
growth of the part of capital consisting of raw materials
which is used up.”</p>
<p>For the increase of products is physically identical with
the growth of this part of capital.  In agriculture on
the other hand
(<a name="tsv3p374">and</a> likewise in the extractive industries), where only a
small proportion of the capital invested is not [annually]
used up (i.e., constant capital) and a relatively large
proportion of capital is used up (as wages for example), the
amount of products, provided the land is fairly fertile, can
be much larger than in the advanced countries where the
ratio of capital invested to capital used up is infinitely
greater.</p>
<p>The second proposition thus amounts to an attempt to
bring in surreptitiously surplus-value (the indispensable
basis of profit).</p>
<p>[Cherbuliez’s conclusion:]</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>The rate of profit</em> or the
<em>ratio</em> of the profit to capital is therefore the
result of the combination of two other ratios, namely the
<em>ratio</em> between the <em>capital laid out</em> and that
<em>used up</em>, and the <em>ratio between the capital used up
and the product</em>” (op.  cit., p. 
70).</p>
<p>Previously, <em>profit</em> ought to have been
explained.  But nothing emerged except a definition of
it which merely states the form in which it appears, i.e.,
the fact that profit is equal to the excess of the value of
the total product over the cost-price of the product or over
the value of the capital used up, which is the vulgar
definition of profit.</p>
<p>Now the <em>rate of profit</em> ought to be
explained.  But once again nothing emerges except the
vulgar definition.  The rate of profit is equal to the
ratio of profit to the total capital, or, what amounts to
the same thing, it is equal to the ratio of the excess of
the value of the product over its cost-price to the total
capital advanced for production.  The distorted
conception and bungling application of the approximately
correct distinction between the elements of capital, and the
vague idea that profit and rate of profit are directly
connected with the ratio of these elements to one another,
only lead to a repetition of the generally known phrases in
a rather doctrinaire fashion, in fact merely to a statement
that profit and rate of profit exist without, however,
anything being said about their nature.</p>
<p>The matter is not improved by the fact that Cherbuliez
expresses his doctrinaire formulae in algebraic
language:</p>
<p class="quote">“Let <em>P</em> be the aggregate
product of a given period of time, <em>C</em> the capital
invested, π the profit, <em>r</em> the <em>ratio</em> of
profit to capital (rate), <em>c</em> the capital used up, then
<em>P–c=π</em>, <em>r=π/C</em> therefore
<em>Cr=π</em>.  Therefore <em>P–c=Cr</em>; therefore
<em>r=P–c/C</em>” (loc. cit., p. 70, Note 1).


<p><a name="tsv3p375">Which</a> means nothing more than that the rate of profit
equals the ratio of profit to capital and that profit equals
the excess of the value of the product over its
cost-price.</p>
<p>In general, when Cherbuliez speaks about consumed and
unconsumed capital he has at the back of his mind the
difference between fixed and circulating capital, and not
the distinction which he himself has drawn, namely, that
between the different types of capital based on the
production process.  Surplus-value is antecedent to
circulation and no matter how much the differences arising
out of circulation affect the rate of profit, they have
nothing to do with the origin of profit.</p>
<p class="quote">“Productive capital […] is
composed of a consumable part […] and a
non-consumable part [… ] The more wealth and
population increase, the more the consumable part tends to
increase, because the extractive industries demand an ever
greater supply of labour.  On the other hand, this same
progress […] causes the <em>amount</em> of capital
invested to increase at a much faster rate than the amount
of capital <em>consumed</em>.  Thus although the total
mass of capital consumed tends to increase […] the
effect is neutralised, because the mass of products grows in
more rapid progression and the <em>total amount of profit</em>
must be considered as growing at a rate at beast as high as
that at which the <em>total amount of capital invested</em>
grows” (loc. cit., p. 71).</p>
<p class="quote">“The amount of profit grows, not the
rate, which is the ratio of this amount to the capital
invested, r=P–c/C.  It is clear that P–c or
the profit, since P–c=π can grow although r
declines, if C grows more rapidly than P–c”
(p. 71, note).</p>
<p>Here the reason for the decline in the rate of profit is
touched on, but in view of the preceding distortions, it can
only lead to confusion and contradictions which cancel each
other out.  First the amount of capital consumed grows
but the amount of products grows even more rapidly (i.e.,
the excess of the value of the products over their
cost-price in this case), for it grows in proportion to the
capital invested and this grows more rapidly than the
capital consumed.  Why the fixed capital grows more
rapidly than the mass of raw materials, for example, is not
explained anywhere.  But never mind, the amount of
profit grows <em>in proportion</em> to the capital
<em>invested</em>, to the total capital, but <span class="context">||1109||</span> <em>the rate of profit</em>
is nevertheless supposed to fall, because the total capital
grows more rapidly than the mass of products or rather than
the amount of profit.</p>
<p>First the <em>amount of profit grows</em> at a rate at
least as great as that at which “the total amount of
the capital invested” grows, and then the rate of
profit <em>falls</em>, because the total amount of capital
invested grows more rapidly than the amount of profit.
<a name="tsv3p376">First</a> <em>P-c</em> grows “at least”
proportionally to <em>C</em>, and then <em>P-c/C</em> falls,
because <em>C</em> increases even more rapidly than
<em>P-c</em>, which increases at least as rapidly as
<em>C</em>.  If we throw aside all this confusion, then
all that remains is the tautology that <em>P-c/C can</em> fall
again although <em>P-c</em> increases, that is, that the rate
of profit can fall although profit increases when the rate
falls.  The rate of profit simply signifies the ratio
of <em>P-c</em> to <em>C</em>, [and this ratio declines] when
capital increases more rapidly than the amount of
profit.</p>
<p>Thus the final pearl of wisdom is that the rate of profit
can fall, that is, the ratio of an increasing amount of
profit to capital can fall when the capital increases more
rapidly than the amount of profit, or if the amount of
profit, despite the absolute growth, declines relatively in
comparison with the capital.  This is nothing but a
different expression for the decline in the rate of
profit.  But that this phenomenon is within the bounds
of possibility, and even its existence, has never been
called to question.  The sole point at issue was
precisely to explain the cause of this phenomenon, and
Cherbuliez explains the decline in the rate of profit, the
decline in the amount of profit in relation to the total
capital, by the relative increase in the amount of profit
which is at least proportionate to the growth of the
capital.  He obviously surmises that the mass of living
labour employed declines relatively to past labour, although
it increases absolutely, and that <em>therefore</em> the rate
of profit must decline.  But he never arrives at a
clear understanding.  The closer one comes to the
threshold of understanding, the more distorted the
statements become, unless the threshold is actually crossed
and [the greater is] the illusion of having crossed it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what he says about the <em>equalisation
of the general rate of profit</em> is very much to the
point.  <span class="context">|1109||</span></p>
<p><span class="context">||1109|</span> “After the
deduction of rent, what remains of the <em>amount of
profit</em>, that is, of the excess of products over the
capital consumed, is divided between the capitalist
producers <em>in proportion to the capital each has
invested</em>, whereas the portion of the product which
corresponds to the capital used up and is intended to
replace it, is divided in proportion with the capital
actually used up.  This <em>dual law of division</em>
comes about <em>as a result of competition</em>, which tends
to equalise the advantages of the different investments of
capital.  Finally, this dual law of division determines
the respective <em>values</em> and <em>prices</em> of the
different kinds of products” (loc. cit.,
pp. 71-72).


<p><a name="tsv3p377">This</a> is very good.  Only the
concluding words are wrong, namely, that the formation of
the general rate of profit determines the <em>values</em> and
<em>prices</em> (it should be prices of production) of
commodities.  On the contrary, the determination of the
value is the primary factor, antecedent to the rate of
profit and to the establishment of production prices. 
How can any kind of <em>division</em> of the “amount of
profit”, i.e., of the surplus-value <span class="context">||1110|</span>—which is itself only a
part of the total value of commodities—determine the
“<em>amount</em> of profit”, that is, the
surplus-value, that is, the value of the commodities? 
This is only correct if, by relative values of commodities,
one means their production prices, The whole lopsidedness of
Cherbuliez’s presentation arises from the fact that he does
not examine the origin and the laws of value and
surplus-value independently.</p>
<p>In other respects, he describes the relation between
wage-labour and capital more or less correctly.</p>
<p>People who neither receive anything by devolution (legal
transfer, inheritance, etc.), nor have any possessions they
can exchange, can<a href="#-ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[b]</a>
“obtain what they need only by offering their
<em>labour</em> to the capitalist.  They only acquire the
right to the things which are allocated to them as the
<em>price of labour</em>, but they have no right to the
<em>product</em> of their labour, nor to the <em>value</em>
which they have added” (op. cit., pp. 55-56). 
“By <em>exchanging</em> his labour for a certain volume
of means of subsistence, […] the worker completely
renounces all right to the other portions of capital
[…]  The distribution of these products remains
the same as it was previously; it is not modified in any way
by the above-mentioned convention.  The products
continue to belong exclusively to the capitalist who has
provided the raw materials and the means of
subsistence.  <em>This is an inescapable sequence of the
law of appropriation, the fundamental principle of</em> which
was, conversely, <em>the exclusive right of every worker to
the product of his labour</em>” (p. 58).</p>
<p>This fundamental principle, according to Cherbuliez, is
as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">“The worker has an exclusive right to
the value resulting from his labour” (p. 48).</p>
<p>Cherbuliez does not understand nor does he explain how
the law of commodities, according to which commodities are
equivalents and exchange with one another in proportion to
their value, i.e., to the labour-time embodied in them,
unexpectedly leads to the result that on the contrary
capitalist production—and only on the basis of
capitalist production is it essential for the product to be
produced as a commodity—depends on the fact that
<a name="tsv3p378">one</a> portion of labour is appropriated without
exchange.  He only senses that a <em>transformation</em>
has suddenly taken place.</p>
<p>This fundamental principle is a pure fiction.  It
arises from the surface appearance of <em>commodity
circulation</em>.  Commodities are exchanged with one
another according to their value, that is, according to the
labour embodied in them.  Individuals confront one
another only as commodity owners and can therefore only
acquire other individuals’ commodities by alienating their
own.  It therefore <em>appears</em> as if they exchanged
only their own labour since the exchange of commodities
which contain <em>other people’s</em> labour, insofar as they
themselves were not acquired by the individuals in exchange
for their own commodities, presupposes different relations
between people than those of [simple] commodity owners, of
buyers d of sellers.  In capitalist production this
appearance, which its surface displays, disappears. 
What does not disappear, however, is the illusion that
originally men confront one another only as commodity owners
and that, consequently, a person is only a property owner
insofar as he is a worker.  As has been stated, this
“originally” is a delusion arising from the
surface appearance of capitalist production and has never
existed historically.  In general, man (isolated or
social) always comes on to the stage as a property owner
before he appears as a worker, even if the property is only
what he procures for himself from nature (or what he as a
member of the family, tribe, communal organisation, procures
partly from nature, partly from the means of production
which have already been produced in common).  And as
soon as the first animal state is left behind, man’s
property in nature is mediated by his existence as a member
of a communal body, family, tribe, etc., by his relationship
to other men, which determines his relationship to
nature.  The “propertyless labourer” as a
“fundamental principle” is rather a creature of
civilisation and, on the historical scale, of
“capitalist production”.  This is a law of
“expropriation” not of
“appropriation”, at least not simply of
appropriation in the way Cherbuliez imagines it, but a kind
of appropriation which corresponds to a definite, specific
mode of production.  <span class="context">|1110||</span></p>
<p><span class="context">||1111|</span> Cherbuliez says:</p>
<p class="quote">“The products are appropriated before
they are converted into capital; and this conversion does
not eliminate such appropriation” (op. cit.,
p. 54).</p>
<p>But this applies not only to the products, but also to
labour.  Raw materials, etc., and instruments belong to
the capitalist.
<a name="tsv3p379">They</a> are the <em>converted</em> form of his money.  On
the other hand, when he has bought labour-power or the daily
(say 12 hours) use of labour-power, with a sum of money
equal to the product of six hours of labour, then the labour
of 12 hours belongs to him; it is <em>appropriated</em> by him
before it is carried out.  The process of production
itself turns labour into capital.  But this
transformation is an act which takes place later than its
appropriation.</p>
<p>The “products” are converted into capital,
<em>physically</em> converted insofar as in the process of
production they function as conditions of labour, conditions
of production, objects and instruments of labour, and
<em>formally</em> converted insofar as not only their
<em>value</em> is perpetuated but as they become means for
absorbing <em>labour and surplus labour</em>, insofar as they
actually function as absorbers of labour.  <span class="context">||1112|</span> On the other hand: the
labour-power <em>appropriated before</em> the [production]
process is turned directly into capital <em>in</em> the course
of the process by being converted into the conditions of
labour and into surplus-value, [since] as a result of its
embodiment in the product, it not only preserves the
constant capital but replaces the variable capital and adds
surplus-value.  <span class="context">|1112||</span></p>
<h3>[4.  On Accumulation as Extended
Reproduction]</h3>
<p>[Cherbuliez writes:]</p>
<p><span class="context">||1110|</span> “Every
accumulation of wealth provides the means for accelerating
further accumulation” (op. cit., p. 29).</p>
<p>{Ricardo’s view (derived from Smith) that all
accumulation can be reduced to expenditure on wages, would
be incorrect even if no accumulation in kind took
place—which is the case, for example, when the farmer
sows more seed, the stock-breeder increases his stock of
cattle for breeding or for fattening, the owner of
engineering works uses part of his surplus-value in the form
of machine tools—and even if all producers who produce
the elements of some part of capital did not over-produce
regularly, counting on the fact of annual accumulation,
i.e., the expansion of the general scale of
production.  Moreover, the peasant can exchange part of
his surplus corn with the stock-breeder, who may convert
this corn into variable capital while the peasant converts
his corn into constant capital [by means of this
exchange].  The flax-grower <span class="context">||1111|</span> sells part of his surplus
product to the spinner, who converts it into constant
capital.  With this money
<a name="tsv3p380">the</a> flax-grower can buy tools and the tool-maker can then
buy iron, etc., so that all these elements are turned
directly into constant capital.</p>
<p>But disregarding all this, let us assume that a
manufacturer of machines wants to convert an additional
capital of £1,000 into elements of production. 
He will of course lay out part of it on wages, say
£200.  But he buys iron, coal, etc., with the
remaining £800.  Let us assume that this iron,
coal, etc., has first to be produced.  Then, if the
iron or coal producers either have no excess (accumulated)
stocks of their commodities, and likewise have no additional
machinery and are unable to buy it immediately (for in this
case too constant capital would be exchanged for constant
capital), they can only produce the required iron and coal
if they work their old machinery longer.  As a result,
they would have to replace it more rapidly, but a part of
its value would enter into the new product. 
Irrespective of this, however, the iron manufacturer needs
more coal in any case and must therefore transform at least
part of his share in the £800 into constant
capital.  Both coal and iron producers sell their wares
in such a way that they contain unpaid surplus labour. 
And if this amounts to a quarter, then this alone means that
£200 out of the £800 is not converted into
wages, not to mention the part which has to make good the
wear and tear of the old machinery.</p>
<p>The surplus consists always of the articles produced by
the particular capital, i.e., coal, iron, etc.  Part of
the surplus is converted directly into constant capital when
the producers whose commodities serve as elements of
production for other producers exchange these commodities
with one another.  That part of the surplus value,
however, which is exchanged against the products of those
who produce means of subsistence and replaces the constant
capital in these branches, provides the necessary variable
capital.  The producers of means of subsistence that
can no longer enter as elements into their production
(except as variable capital) acquire additional constant
capital through the same process which provides the other
producers with additional variable capital.</p>
<p>The following features distinguish
reproduction—insofar as it constitutes accumulation
—from simple reproduction.</p>
<p><em>Firstly:</em> Both the constant and variable elements
of production which are accumulated consist of newly added
labour.  They are not used as revenue, although they
arise from profit.  They consist of profit or surplus
labour, whereas in the case of simple reproduction
<a name="tsv3p381">part</a> of the product represents past labour
(i.e., in this context, labour which has not been performed
in the current year).</p>
<p><em>Secondly:</em> If the labour-time in certain branches
is lengthened, that is, if no additional instruments or
machines are employed, the new product must indeed, to a
certain extent, pay for the more rapid wear and tear of the
old [tools or machines], and this accelerated consumption of
the old constant capital is likewise an aspect of
accumulation.</p>
<p><em>Thirdly:</em> As a result of the additional money
capital which arises in the process of [extended]
reproduction—partly through the freeing of capital,
partly through the conversion of part of the product into
money, partly because, as a result of the money collected by
the producer, the demand for other [commodities], e.g.,
[those offered by the] sellers of luxury goods, is
reduced—the systematic replacement of the elements [of
production] is by no means a necessity, as it is in the case
of simple reproduction.</p>
<p>With the additional money anyone can buy or command
products, although the producer from whom the purchase is
made may neither expend his revenue on the product of the
purchaser nor replace his capital with it}. 
&lt;Additional capital (constant or variable) must appear
in the form of money capital on one side, even if this only
exists in the form of outstanding claims, whenever it is not
balanced by a corresponding addition on the other
side.&gt;</p>
<h3>[5.  Elements of Sismondism in Cherbuliez.  On
the Organic Composition of Capital Fixed and Circulating
Capital]</h3>
<p>For the rest, Cherbuliez presents a remarkable amalgam of
Sismondian and Ricardian contradictory views.  <span class="context">|1111||</span></p>
<p><span class="context">||1112|</span>
<em>Sismondian</em>.</p>
<p class="quote">“The hypothesis […] that an
<em>invariable ratio exists</em> between the different
elements of capital is not substantiated at any stage of the
development of society.  The relationship is
essentially <em>variable</em> and for two reasons: a)the
division of labour, and b) the replacement of human labour
by natural agents.  These two factors tend to reduce
the <em>ratio</em> of the means of subsistence to the other
two elements of capital” (op. cit., pp. 61-62).</p>
<p>In this situation, “the <em>increase in productive
capital</em> does not necessarily bead to an increase in the
amount of means of subsistence intended to constitute the
price of labour; it can be accompanied—at beast for a
time—by
<a name="tsv3p382">an</a> absolute diminution of this element of capital, and
consequently by a <em>reduction in the price of
labour</em>” (loc. cit., p. 63).</p>
<p>&lt;This is Sismondian; the effect on the <em>wage
level</em> is the only aspect considered by Cherbuliez. 
This problem does not arise at all in an investigation where
labour is always supposed to be paid at its value and the
fluctuations of the market price of labour above or below
that point (the value [of labour]) are not taken into
consideration.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“The producer who wishes to introduce
a new division of labour in his enterprise or to exploit
some natural force, will not wait until he has accumulated
sufficient capital to be able to employ in this new way
<em>all</em> the workers he needed previously.  In the
case of division of labour, he will perhaps be satisfied to
produce with five workers what he previously produced with
ten.  In the case of the exploitation of a natural
force, he will perhaps use only one machine and two
workers.  The means of subsistence will, in
consequence, be reduced to 1,500 in the first case and to
600 in the second.  But since the number of workers
remains the same, <em>their corn petition</em> will soon force
the price of labour below its original level”
(loc. cit., pp.  63-64).  “This is one of the
most astonishing results of the <em>law of
appropriation</em>.  The absolute increase in wealth,
that is, in the products of labour, does not give rise to a
proportional increase and may lead to a diminution in the
means of subsistence for the workers, in the portion they
receive of all kinds of products” (p. 64). 
“The factors determining the <em>price of
labour”&lt;</em>in this context it is always a
question only of the <em>market price</em> of labour&gt;
“are the absolute amount of productive capital and the
ratio between the different elements of capital, two social
facts on which the will of the workers can exercise no
influence” (p. 64).  “Nearly all the odds
are against the worker” (loc. cit.).</p>
<p>The ratio between the different elements of productive
capital is determined in two ways:</p>
<p><em>First:</em> By the organic composition of productive
capital.  By this we mean the technological
composition.  With a <em>given productivity</em> of
labour, which can be taken as constant so long as no change
occurs, the amount of raw material and means of labour, that
is, the amount of constant capital—in terms of its
<em>material elements—which</em> corresponds to a
definite <em>quantity of living labour</em> (paid or unpaid),
that is, to the <em>material elements</em> of <em>variable</em>
capital, is determined in every sphere of production.</p>
<p>If the proportion of the materialised labour to the
living labour employed is small, then the portion of the
product that represents living labour will be large
regardless of how this portion is divided between capitalist
and worker.  If the reverse is the case, the portion
will be small.  With a given rate of exploitation of
labour, the surplus labour too will be large in the former
case
<a name="tsv3p383">and</a> small in the latter.  This can only change as a
result of a change in the mode of production which alters
the technological relationship between the two parts of
capital.  Even in this case, the absolute amount of
living labour employed by the capital which uses a greater
proportion of constant capital may be equal or even larger
if capitals of different <em>size</em> are compared.  But
it must be smaller <em>relatively</em>.  For capitals of
the same size, or calculated in proportion to the total
capital—100 for example—it must be smaller both
relatively and absolutely.  All changes arising from
the development (not the decline) of the productive power of
labour, reduce that part of the product which represents
living labour, that is, they reduce variable capital. 
Regarding capital invested in different branches of
production <span class="context">||1113|</span> , one can
say [that these changes] reduce the <em>variable</em> capital
absolutely in those branches which have reached a higher
level of production, since wages are assumed to be
equal.</p>
<p>So much with regard to the changes arising from changes
in the mode of production.</p>
<p><em>Secondly</em>, however, if one assumes that the organic
composition of capitals is given and likewise the
differences which arise from the differences in their
organic composition, then the <em>value ratio</em> can change
although the technological composition remains the
same.  What can happen is: a) a change in the value of
constant capital; b) a change in the value of the variable
capital; c) a <em>change in both</em>, in equal or unequal
proportions.</p>
<p>a) If the technological composition remains the same and
a change in the value of constant capital takes place, its
value will either fall or rise.  If it falls, and only
the same amount of living labour is employed as previously,
i.e., if the <em>scale</em> or <em>level of production</em>
remains the same, if, for example, 100 men are employed as
previously, then in physical terms, the same amount of raw
material and means of labour is required as
previously.  But the surplus labour bears a greater
proportion to the total capital advanced.  The rate of
profit rises.  In the opposite case it declines. 
In the former case, for the capitals already employed in
that sphere (not those newly invested in it after the change
of value in the elements of constant capital has taken
place), the total sum of the capital employed diminishes,
that is, some portion of the capital is set free, although
production continues to be carried on on the same scale; or
the capital thus liberated is again employed in the same
sphere of production and has then the same effect as an
accumulation of capital.  The scale of production is
enlarged,
<a name="tsv3p384">and</a> the absolute amount of surplus labour is increased
proportionally.  With a given <em>method of
production</em>, every accumulation of capital results in an
increase in the total amount of surplus-value whatever the
rate of surplus-value may be.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the value of the elements of constant
capital increases, then <em>either the scale of
production</em> (hence the mass of the total capital
advanced) must increase to employ the <em>same quantity</em>
of labour (the same variable capital the value of which has
remained unchanged) as before; and then although the
absolute amount of surplus-value—and the rate of
surplus-value—remains the same, its proportion to the
total capital advanced decreases, and hence the rate of
profit falls.  Or the scale of production and the total
capital advanced is not enlarged, then in all circumstances,
the variable capital must decrease.</p>
<p>If the same sum as previously is laid out in constant
capital, it now represents a smaller amount of material
elements and since the <em>technological conditions</em>
remain the same, less labour will be employed.  The
total capital advanced therefore decreases by [an amount
corresponding to] the labour dismissed; the total value of
the capital advanced thus decreases, but a greater
proportion of the diminished capital is laid out in constant
capital (in terms of value).  The surplus-value
decreases absolutely, because less labour is employed, and
the ratio of the remaining surplus-value to the total
capital advanced falls, because variable capital bears a
smaller proportion to constant capital.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the same total capital is employed
as before—the reduced value of the variable capital
(representing a smaller quantity of labour, living labour,
employed), being counterbalanced by the increased value of
the constant capital; the one being diminished in the same
proportion as the other is augmented, then the absolute
quantity of surplus-value falls; because less labour is
employed, and at the same time, the proportion of this
surplus-value to the total capital advanced falls. 
Thus the rate of profit falls for two reasons, the
diminution in the amount of surplus labour, and the
decreasing proportion of that surplus labour to the total
capital advanced.</p>
<p>In the first case where (with decreasing value of the
elements of constant capital) the <em>rate of profit
rises</em> in all circumstances, the<em class="stretch">
scale of production </em>must be extended if the <em>amount
of profit</em> is to increase.  Let us assume that the
capital is 600—half constant, half variable.  If
the constant capital were to lose half its value, it would
only amount to 150, although the <a name="tsv3p385">variable</a> capital would remain 300. 
The total capital employed would be only 450, 150 being
freed.  If the 150 are added to the capital again, then
100 of the 150 will now be laid out in variable
capital.  <span class="context">||1114|</span> Thus the
<em>scale of production</em> is expanded and more labour
employed, if the same capital continues to be used in the
production process.</p>
<p>In the opposite case, where with rising value of the
elements of constant capital the <em>rate of profit</em> falls
in all circumstances, the <em>scale of production</em>, and
therefore the capital advanced, must be increased if the
amount of profit <em>is not to decrease</em> and the
<em>amount</em> of labour employed (and therefore
surplus-value) is to remain the same.  If this is not
done, if only the old or less than the old capital is
employed, then not only does the rate of profit decline, but
also the amount of profit.</p>
<p>The rate of surplus-value remains unchanged in both
cases; it changes, however, if any change in the
<em>technological</em> composition of capital takes place: it
increases if the constant capital increases (because labour
is then more productive) and declines when it falls (because
labour is then less productive).</p>
<p>b) If there is any change in the value of variable
capital independent of the <em>organic composition</em>, it
can only occur because of a fall or a rise in the price of
means of subsistence that are not produced in the sphere of
production under consideration but enter into it as
commodities from outside.</p>
<p>If the <em>value of variable</em> capital falls, it
nevertheless represents the same amount of living labour as
before.  The same quantity of labour merely costs
less.  If therefore the <em>scale of production</em>
remains the same (since the value of constant capital is
unchanged), then the part of the total capital used for the
purchase of labour is diminished.  Less capital needs
to be laid out in order to pay the same number of
workers.  Thus, in this case, if the <em>scale of
production remains the same</em>, the amount of capital laid
out diminishes.  The rate of profit increases, and this
for two reasons.  The [<em>amount of</em>]
<em>surplus-value has increased;</em> the ratio of living
labour to materialised labour has remained the same, but the
increased surplus-value correlates with a smaller total
capital.  If, on the other hand, the capital freed is
again invested, then this amounts to
<em>accumulation</em>.</p>
<p>If the <em>value of the variable capital</em> increases,
then a greater total capital must also be laid out in order
to employ the same number of workers as before, because the
value of the constant capital remains the same and that of
the variable capital has <a name="tsv3p386">risen</a>. 
The amount of labour remains the same, but a smaller part of
it is surplus labour, and this smaller part corresponds to a
larger capital.  This takes place when the <em>scale of
production remains the same</em>, while the value of the
total capital increases.  If the value of the total
capital does not increase, the <em>scale of production</em>
must be reduced.  The amount of labour declines and a
smaller portion of this reduced amount constitutes surplus
labour, which, too, bears a smaller proportion to the total
capital advanced.</p>
<p>The organic changes and those brought about by changes of
value can have a similar effect on the rate of profit in
certain circumstances.  They differ however in the
following way.  If the latter are not due simply to
fluctuations of market prices and are therefore not
temporary, they are invariably caused by an organic change
in the spheres that provide the elements of constant or of
variable capital.</p>
<p>[c)] It is not necessary here to examine <em>case 3</em> in
detail.</p>
<p>In the case of capitals of equal size—or if the
calculation is based on equal amounts of the total capital,
100, for example— the <em>organic composition</em> may
be <em>the same</em> in <em>different spheres of
production</em>, but the <em>value ratio</em> of the primary
component parts of constant and variable capital may be
<em>different</em> according to the different values of the
amount of instruments and raw materials used.  For
example, copper instead of iron, iron instead of lead, wool
instead of cotton, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, is it possible for the organic
composition to be different if the <em>value ratio</em>
remains the same?  If the organic composition is the
same, the relative amounts which constitute constant capital
and living labour are <em>the same</em> per 100.  The
quantitative proportions are the same.  The value of
the constant capital may be the same, although the relative
amounts of labour set in motion are different.  If the
machinery or raw materials are dearer (or cheaper), less
labour, for example, may be required, but in this case the
value of the variable capital is also relatively smaller or
vice versa.</p>
<p><span class="context">||1115|</span> Let us take A and
B.  <em>c’</em> and <em>v’</em> are the component parts (in
terms of value) of A, and <em>c</em> and <em>v</em> those of B
(again in terms of value).  If <em>c’:v’</em> is equal to
<em>c:v</em> then <em>c’v</em> equals <em>v’c</em>. 
Consequently likewise <em>c’/c</em> equals <em>v’/v</em>.</p>
<p>Since the <em>value ratios</em> [of constant to variable
capital] are equal, only the following variations are
possible.  If in one sphere <em>more surplus labour is
carried out</em> than in another sphere, &lt;for
<a name="tsv3p387">example</a>, night work is impossible in agriculture, and
although the individual agricultural labourer can be
over-worked, nevertheless the total amount of labour which
can be expended on a given area of land is limited by the
object being produced (corn), whereas in a factory of a
given size the amount produced depends
(δυνάμει<a href="#-ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[c]</a>) on the hours of
labour worked—that is to say, it is due to the
different kinds of production that more surplus labour can
be employed in one sphere at a given level of production
than in another&gt; then, even if the value ratio of
constant and variable capital is the same, the amount of
labour employed in proportion to the total capital will
nevertheless be different.</p>
<p>Or, let us assume that the raw material is dearer and
labour (of greater <em>skill</em>) is dearer, in the same
proportion.  In this case [capitalist] A employs 5
workers, where [capitalist] B employs 25, and they cost him
£100—as much as the 25 workers, because their
labour is dearer (their surplus labour is therefore also
worth more).  These 5 workers work up 100 lbs. of raw
material, <em>y</em>, worth [£] 500 and B’s workers work
up 1,000 lbs. of raw material, <em>x</em>, worth [£]
500, because the raw material is dearer and the productive
power of the workers is less highly developed in the case of
A.  The value ratio here—£100 <em>v</em> to
[£] 500 <em>c</em> is he same in both cases, but the
<em>organic composition</em> is different.</p>
<p>The <em>value ratio</em> is the same: The value of constant
capital in A is the same as in B, and proportionately A lays
out the same amount of capital in, wages as B.  But the
quantity of his products will be smaller.  Although he
employs the same absolute quantity of labour as B, he uses
more relatively, because his constant capital is
dearer.  He processes less raw material, etc., in the
same time, but this smaller quantity costs him as much as
the larger quantity processed by B.  The <em>value
ratio</em> in this case is the same, the organic composition
is different.  In the other case the value ratio being
assumed to be the same, this can occur only if the amounts
of the surplus labour are different or if the value of the
different kinds of labour are different.</p>
<p>The organic composition can be taken to mean the
following: Different ratios in which it is necessary to
expend constant capital in the different spheres of
production in order to absorb the same amount of
labour.  The <em>combination of the same amount of
labour</em> with the object of labour requires either that
both
<a name="tsv3p388">more</a> raw material and more machinery are used in one case
than in the other, or that more of only one of these is
used.</p>
<p>{Where the ratios between fixed and circulating capital
are very different, those between <em>constant and
variable</em> capital can be <em>the same</em>, consequently
the surplus-value can be the same although the <em>values</em>
produced annually must be different.  Let us assume
that in the coal industry—where no raw materials are
used (apart from auxiliary materials), the fixed capital
constitutes half the total capital and variable capital the
other half.  Let us assume that in tailoring the fixed
capital is zero (as in the previous case we disregard
auxiliary materials), that the raw materials constitute half
and the variable capital the other half of the total
capital.  Given the same degree of exploitation of
labour, both will realise the same amount of
<em>surplus-value</em>, since both employ the same amount of
labour in proportion to capital, i.e., per 100.  But
let us assume that fixed capital in the coal industry turns
over once every 10 years while there is no difference in the
rate of turnover of circulating capital in both cases. 
At the end of the year (we will assume that the variable
capital turns over once a year in both cases) the tailor’s
capital will have produced va1ues amounting to 150 if the
surplus-value is 50.  The coal producer, on the other
hand, will have produced values amounting to 105 at the end
of the first year (consisting of 5 for fixed capital, 50 for
variable and 50 for surplus labour).  As in the case of
the tailor, the total value of his product plus the fixed
capital will amount to 150, that is, the product, 105, plus
45 for the remaining fixed capital.  The production of
different magnitudes of value therefore does not preclude
the production of <em>the same</em> amount of
surplus-value.</p>
<p>In the second year, the fixed capital of the coal
producer would amount to 45, variable capital to 50 and
surplus-value to 50, that is, the capital advanced would be
95 and the profit would be 50.  The rate of profit
would have <em>risen</em>, because the value of the fixed
<span class="context">||1116|</span> capital would have
declined by one tenth as a result of wear and tear during
the first year.  Thus there can be no doubt that in the
case of all capitals employing a great deal of fixed
capital—provided the scale of production remains
unchanged—the rate of profit must <em>rise</em> in
proportion as the value of the machinery, the fixed capital,
declines annually, because wear and tear has already been
taken into account.  If the coal producer sells his
coal at the same price throughout the ten years, then his
rate of profit must be higher in the second
<a name="tsv3p389">year</a> than it was in the first and so forth.  Or
one would have to assume that the maintenance work, etc.,
stands in direct proportion to the depreciation, so that the
total sum advanced annually under the heading of fixed
capital remains the same.  This extra profit may be
equalised also as a result of the fact that—apart from
wear and tear—the value of fixed capital alls in the
course of time, because it has to compete with new, more
recently invented, better machinery.  On the other hand
this rising rate of profit, which results naturally from
wear and tear, makes it possible for the declining value of
the fixed capital to compete with newer, better machinery,
the full value of which has still to be taken into
account.  Finally, the coal producer sold his coal more
cheaply [at the end of the second year], on the basis of the
following calculation: 50 on 100 means 50 per cent profit,
50 per cent on 95 comes to 47 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub>; if
therefore he sold the same quantity of coal [not for 105
but] for 102 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub>—then he would
have sold it more cheaply than the man whose machinery, for
example, began to operate only in the current year. 
Large installations of fixed capital presuppose possession
of large amounts of capital.  And since these big
owners of capital dominate the market, it appears that only
for this reason their enterprises yield surplus profit
(rent).  In the case of agriculture, this rent derives
from working relatively fertile land, but here we are
dealing with a case where relatively cheaper machinery is
utilised.}</p>
<p>&lt;A large number of instances which are adduced in
connection with the relation of fixed to circulating
capital, refer to the difference between variable and
constant capital.  First of all, the proportion of
constant to variable capital can be the same although the
proportion of fixed to circulating capital is
different.  Secondly, in the case of constant and
variable capital it is a question of the primary division of
capital between living and <em>materialised</em> labour,
<em>not</em> of the modification of this relationship by the
circulation process or the influence of this latter on
reproduction.</p>
<p>It is clear first of all that the difference between
fixed and circulating capital can affect surplus-value
(apart from the differences in the mass of living labour
employed, i.e., differences which are related to the ratio
of variable to constant capital) only insofar as it affects
the <em>turnover</em> of the total capital.  It is
therefore necessary to investigate how the <em>turnover</em>
affects surplus-value.  Two factors are obviously
closely connected with it: <a name="tsv3p390">1)</a>
surplus-value cannot be accumulated, reconverted into
capital, so rapidly (so often); 2) the <em>capital
advanced</em> must increase both to continue to employ the
same number of workers, etc., and because the advances of
money which the capitalist makes to himself to cover his own
consumption costs must extend over a longer period. 
These factors are important in connection with
<em>profit</em>.  Here, however, it is, to begin, with,
only necessary to examine how they affect
surplus-value.  One must moreover always clearly
distinguish between these two factors.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Everything which increases the <em>capital
outlay</em> without proportionally increasing the
surplus-value, reduces the rate of profit even if the
surplus-value remains the same; the opposite is the case
with everything which reduces the outlay.  Insofar,
therefore, as a large amount of fixed capital in proportion
to circulating capital—or different turnover periods
of capital— affects the size of the capital outlay, it
affects the rate of profit even if it does not at all affect
the surplus-value.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;The rate of profit is not simply the surplus-value
calculated on the capital advanced, but the mass of
surplus-value realised within a given period, that is, in a
definite period of circulation.  Insofar as the
difference between fixed and circulating capital affects the
mass of surplus-value which a particular capital yields
<em>within a given period</em>, it affects the rate of
profit.  Two aspects must be taken into consideration:
firstly, the difference in the size of the <em>capital
advanced</em> (relative to the surplus-value realised) and
secondly, the difference in the <em>length of time</em> for
which these advances have to be made before they are
returned with a surplus.&gt;</p>
<p><span class="context">||1117|</span> {The reproduction
time, or rather, the number of reproductions taking place in
a definite period of time, is substantially affected by two
circumstances.</p>
<p>1)<em>The product remains longer in the sphere of
production, in the strict sense of the term</em>.</p>
<p><em>It is possible firstly</em> that, in order to be
produced, one product requires a longer period of time than
another; it may require a larger part of a year, a whole
year or even more than a year.(The latter is the case for
example with buildings, in stock-breeding and the production
of certain luxuries.)  In this case, the product
continually absorbs labour—often a great deal of
labour is absorbed (for instance by luxury articles and
buildings) in relation to the constant capital—the
amount depending
<a name="tsv3p391">on</a> the composition of the productive capital, its
division into constant and variable capital.  Thus in
the measure as the time required for the production of the
commodity increases and the labour process continues
uniformly, a continuous absorption of labour and of surplus
labour takes place.  This happens for example with
cattle or buildings if the latter require more than a year’s
work.  The product can enter the sphere of circulation,
that is, it can be sold, be thrown on the market, only when
the work is completed.  The surplus labour expended in
the first year is embodied with the rest of the labour in
the unfinished product of the first year.  It is
neither greater nor smaller than in other branches of
production where constant and variable capital are used in
the same proportions.  But the value of the product
cannot be <em>realised</em>, that is, in the sense that it
cannot be converted into money, and neither can the
surplus-value.  The latter cannot therefore be
accumulated as capital nor used for consumption.  The
capital advanced, and also the surplus-value, serve, so to
speak, as foundations for further production.  They are
a precondition for it and enter, to some extent, as
semi-finished products, or, in one way or another, as raw
material into the production process of the second year.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the capital is [£] 500, labour
[£] 100 and surplus-value [£] 50, so that the
capital advanced in production amounts to [£] 550 plus
[£] 500 which is advanced in the second year. 
The surplus-value is again [£] 50.  The value of
the product is therefore [£] 1,100, of which [£]
100 is surplus-value.  In this case, the surplus-value
is the same as if the capital had been reproduced in the
first year and [£] 500 had been invested again in the
second year.  In each year the variable capital
employed is [£] 100 and the surplus-value [£]
50.  But the <em>rate of profit</em> is different. 
In the first year it is <sup class="ratio">50</sup>/<sub class="ratio">500</sub>, or 10
per cent.  But in the second year the capital outlay
amounts to [£] 550 plus [£] 500, that is,
[£] 1,050, and a tenth of this is [£] 105. 
If one adds the same rate of profit, then the value of the
product comes to: [£] 550 in the first year; [£]
550+ [£]500+ [£] 55 + [£] 50=
[£]1,155 in the second year.  At the end of the
second year, the value of the product is [£]
1,155.  Otherwise it would have been only [£]
1,100.  In this case, the profit is greater than the
surplus-value produced, for this only amounts to [£]
100.  If one includes the consumption costs which the
capitalist has to advance over two years, then the capital
laid out
<a name="tsv3p392">is</a> even greater in proportion to the surplus-value. 
On the other hand, it is true that the <em>entire</em>
surplus-value gained in the first year has been converted
into capital in the second.  Furthermore, the capital
laid out in wages is greater, because the £100 is not
reproduced at the end of the first year, so that in the
second year £200 must be advanced for the same labour
for which £100 would have been sufficient if it had
been reproduced in the first year.</p>
<p><em>Secondly</em>.  After the labour process has been
completed, the product must continue to remain in the
production sphere in order to undergo natural processes
which require either no labour or relatively quite
insignificant amounts of it, like wine in the cellar. 
Only when this period has elapsed can the capital be
reproduced.  It is obvious that in this case quite
irrespective of what the ratio of variable to constant
capital may have been, the effect is the same as if more
constant and less variable capital had been laid out. 
The surplus labour, as well as the total amount of labour
employed during a de finite period of time, is
smaller.  If the <em>rate of profit</em> is the same,
this is due to equalisation, not to the amount of
surplus-value produced in this sphere.  More capital
must be advanced beforehand to maintain the reproduction
process—the continuity of production.  And for
this very reason the surplus-value declines <em>in
proportion</em> to the capital advanced.</p>
<p><em>Thirdly</em>.  <em>Interruptions in the labour
process</em> while the product is in the production process,
as in agriculture or in processes such as tanning, etc.,
where chemical processes involve intervals before the
product can proceed from one stage to the next, higher
one.  If in such cases, the interval is reduced by
chemical discoveries, the productivity of labour rises, the
surplus-value is increased and materialised labour has to be
advanced for a shorter period of time.  In all these
cases, the surplus-value is smaller and the capital outlay
larger.</p>
<p>2) The same thing happens if the rate of turnover of the
circulating capital is lower than the average because of
distant markets, In this case, too, the capital outlay is
greater, the surplus-value smaller and its <em>proportion</em>
to the capital advanced is also smaller.}  &lt;In the
latter case [the capital] is retained longer in the
circulation sphere, in the former case, in the production
sphere.&gt;</p>
<p><span class="context">||1118|</span> {Let us assume that
the capital advanced in some branch or other of the
transport industry is [£] 1,000—fixed <a name="tsv3p393">capital</a> [£] 500, which will be
worn out in five years.  The variable capital, which
amounts to [£] 500, turns over four times during the
year.  The annual value of the product will thus be
[£] 100 + [£] 2,000 + [£] 100, if the
[annual] rate of surplus-value is 20 per cent, a total of
[£] 2,200.  On the other hand, let us assume that
in a branch of tailoring the constant capital, which
consists only of circulating capital since fixed capital is
assumed to be zero, amounts to 500 and the variable capital
to 500, surplus-value is 100.  [The capital] turns over
four times a year.  Then the (annual) value of the
product will be 4(500+500)+100, that is, 4,100.  The
surplus-value is the same in both cases.  In the
last-mentioned case, the entire capital turns over four
times a year or once a quarter.  Of the other capital
[£] 600 turn over in the course of a year [of which
£ 500 turn over four times], therefore [£] 500 +
<sup class="ratio">100</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub> = [£] 525 in a quarter of
a year.  That is, 175 in a month, [£] 350 in two
months, and [£] 1,400 in eight months.  The whole
capital requires 5 <sup class="ratio">5</sup>/<sub class="ratio">7</sub> months in order
to turn over.  It turns over only
2<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub> times a year.</p>
<p>Now it will be said that in order to make a profit of 10
per cent, less is added per quarter on a value of
[£]1,000 in the case of the first capital than in that
of the other.  But here it is not a question of
addition.  One makes more surplus-value on the capital
used up but not on the capital employed.  The
difference here arises from the surplus-value, not from the
addition of profit.  The difference here lies in the
value not in the surplus-value.  In both cases the
variable capital amounting to 500 turns over four times in a
year.  Both capitals yield a surplus-value of
[£]100 in a year, the [annual] rate of surplus-value
amounts to 20 per cent.  But £25 in a quarter,
therefore a higher percentage?  [£]25 on
[£]500 each quarter is 5 per cent a quarter, that is,
20 per cent per annum.</p>
<p>The first [capitalist] turns over half his capital 4
times a year and only a fifth of the remaining half once
during the year.  A half of four times is
<em>twice</em>.  Thus he turns his capital over 2
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub> times during the year.  The
entire capital of the second capitalist turns over four
times a year.  But this makes absolutely no difference
to the surplus-value.  If the second capitalist
continues the reproduction process uninterruptedly, then he
must constantly convert [£] 500 into raw materials,
etc., and must always use [£] 500 for labour, while
the other capitalist likewise
<a name="tsv3p394">uses</a> [£] 500 for labour and has invested the
remaining [£]500 once and for all (that is, for five
years) in such a form that he does not need to reconvert it
again.  This applies however only when the ratio of
variable to constant capital is the same [in both capitals]
despite the difference between fixed and circulating
capital.</p>
<p>If in both cases, one half consists of constant and the
other half of variable capital, then it is only possible for
one half [in one case] to consist of fixed capital if the
circulating constant capital amounts to zero, and [in the
other case], one half can consist of circulating constant
capital only if the fixed capital amounts to zero. 
Although the circulating constant capital can amount to
zero, as in the extractive and transport industries where,
however, the auxiliary materials rather than the raw
materials constitute the circulating constant capital, the
fixed capital can never be zero (except in banking,
etc.).  This is however immaterial so long as the ratio
of constant capital to variable capital is the same in both
cases, even though in one case there may be more fixed and
less circulating constant capital than in the other, or vice
versa.  The only difference here is the time of
reproduction required by one half of the capital and by the
total capital.  One capitalist must invest a capital of
£500 for five years before it is returned to him, the
other, for a quarter of a year or a whole year.  The
ability to dispose of the capital is different.  The
amount advanced is the same but the time for which it is
advanced is different.  This difference does not
concern us here.  When one considers the total capital
outlay, surplus-value and profit are the
same—£100 in the first year on the £1,000
advanced.  In the second year, it is rather the fixed
capital that has a higher rate of profit, since the variable
capital has remained the same, whereas the value of the
fixed capital has declined.  The capitalist only
advances [£] 400 fixed and [£] 500 variable
capital in the second year and receives a profit of
[£] 100 as he did before.  But 100 on 900 amounts
to 11 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub> per cent, while the other
capitalist, if he continues to reproduce his capital,
advances [£] 1,000 as he did previously and makes a
profit of [£]100, that is, 10 per cent.</p>
<p>The position is different, of course, if, along with the
fixed capital, the constant capital as a whole increases as
compared with the variable, or if altogether more capital
must be advanced in order to set the same amount of labour
in motion.  In the case discussed above, the question
is not how often the total
<a name="tsv3p395">capital</a> is returned or how large the advance is, but how
often that portion is returned which is sufficient to set
the same amount of productive labour in motion as that used
in the other instance, in order to renew the process of
production.  However, if in the case cited above, the
fixed capital were [not £500 but £] 1,000 and
the circulating capital only [£] 500 [as previously],
then matters would be different.  This, however, would
not be due to the fact that it is fixed capital.  For
if the circulating part of the constant capital in the
second case were to amount to [£]1,000 instead of
[£] 500 (because of the dearness of raw materials, for
example), then the result would be the same.  Because
in the first examples [of the two cases] the larger the
fixed capital, the greater the relative size of the capital
outlay as a whole to the variable capital, these two factors
are often confused.  Moreover, the whole business of
the turnover was in fact originally derived from merchant
capital, where it is determined by different laws.  In
the case of merchant capital, as I have demonstrated, the
rate of profit is indeed determined by the average number of
turnovers, regardless of the composition of this type of
capital which, incidentally, consists mainly of circulating
capital.  For in the case of merchant capital, profit
is determined by the general rate of profit.}</p>
<p><span class="context">||1119|</span> &lt;(The point is
this.  If the fixed capital equals x, and it turns over
only once every 15 years, then <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">15</sub> of
it is turned over in a single year, but likewise only
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">15</sub> needs to be replaced each
year.  It would make no difference at all if it were
replaced 15 times in a year.  Its mass would still be
the same as before.  The product would only become
dearer as a result.  But it is more difficult to
dispose of it and the risk of depreciation is greater than
if the same amount of capital were advanced in the form of
circulating capital.  But this does not affect the
<em>surplus</em> [-value] in any way, although it does enter
into the capitalists calculation of the <em>rate of
profit</em> since this risk is included in the calculation of
the depreciation.</p>
<p>As far as the other part of capital is concerned, let us
assume that the circulating part of constant
capital—raw materials and auxiliary
materials—amounts to [£] 25,000 a year and wages
to [£] 5,000.  If it were returned only once
during the year £30,000 would have to be advanced
during the whole year, and if the surplus-value were at the
rate of 100 per cent it would amount to £5,000, and
profit at the end of the year would be 5,000 on 30,000, or
16 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> per cent.
<a name="tsv3p396">If</a>, on the other hand, [the capital turns over] five
times during the year, then a capital outlay of only
[£] 5,000 for constant circulating capital and
[£] 1,000 for wages will be sufficient.  Profit
will be [£] l ,000, and for five-fifths of a year
[£] 5,000.  But this surplus-value is made on a
capital of £6,000, because more than this amount is
never advanced.  Profit would therefore be 5,000 on
6,000, or <sup class="ratio">5</sup>/<sub class="ratio">6</sub>, five times as much [as
previously], that is, 83 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> per
cent.  (Disregarding fixed capital.)  There is
thus a very considerable difference in the rate of profit
because, in fact, labour worth [£] 5,000 is bought
with a capital of [£] 1,000 and raw materials, etc.,
worth [£] 25,000 with a capital of [£]
5,000.  If the amounts of capital were equal in these
cases of different rates of turnover, then only [£]
6,000 need have been advanced in the first case, that is
only [£] 500 a month, five-sixths of which would have
consisted of constant capital and one-sixth of variable
capital.  This sixth would amount to [£] 83
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>, on which surplus-value at 100
per cent would be £83 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>, and
this would amount in a year to
(83+<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>)12 =
<sup class="ratio">12</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>(or 4)+996= [£]1,000. 
But 1,000 on 6,000=16 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> per
cent.&gt;</p>
<h3>[6.  Cherbuliez Eclectically Combines Mutually
Exclusive Propositions of Ricardo and Sismondi]</h3>
<p><em>To return to Cherbuliez</em>.</p>
<p>[The following is] <em>Sismondian:</em></p>
<p class="quote">“Insofar as the economic progress of
society is characterised by an absolute growth of productive
capital and by a <em>change in the proportions</em> between
the different elements of capital, it offers the workers
some advantages [… ] First, productivity<a href="#-ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[d]</a> of labour […],
resulting especially from the use of machinery, brings about
such a rapid growth of productive capital that despite the
change that takes place in the proportion of the <em>means of
subsistence</em> to the other elements of capital, this
element nevertheless increases absolutely, which makes it
possible not only to employ the same number of workers as
before, but also an additional number, so that for the
workers the result of progress […] <em>apart from some
interruptions</em> means an increase in productive capital
and in the demand for labour.  Secondly, the<a href="#-ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[e]</a> greater productivity
of capital tends to diminish the value of the whole mass of
products considerably, thus <em>placing them within reach of
the workers</em>, thereby increasing the range of enjoyments
they are able to obtain” (op. cit., p. 65).</p>
<p>On the other hand:</p>
<p class="quote">“<a name="tsv3p397">First</a>, however
impermanent, however partial the temporary diminution of the
means of subsistence which constitute the price of labour
may be, it produces harmful effects
nevertheless…  Second, the factors tending to
promote the economic advance of society are for the most
part accidental, independent of the will of the producing
capitalist.  The effects of these causes are therefore
not permanent…” etc. (p. 66). 
“Third, it is not so much the <em>absolute</em> as the
<em>relative</em> amount consumed by the worker which makes
his lot happy or unhappy.  What does it matter to the
worker if he is able to obtain a few more products which
formerly were inaccessible to him if the <em>number of
products inaccessible to him has grown in even greater
proportion, if the distance which separates him from the
capitalist</em> has only increased, if his social position
has deteriorated and become more disadvantageous? 
Apart from the consumption strictly necessary for the
maintenance of our strength, the <em>value of our enjoyments
is essentially relative</em>” (loc.  cit., p. 67).</p>
<p class="quote">“People frequently forget […]
that the wage-labourer is a thinking man, endowed with the
same capacities, impelled by the same motives as the working
capitalist” (p. 67).</p>
<p><span class="context">||1120|</span> “Whatever
advantages a rapid growth in social wealth may bring to the
wage-workers, <em>it does not cure the causes of their
poverty</em>…  They continue <em>to be deprived of
all rights to capital and are consequently obliged to sell
their labour and to renounce all claims to the products of
their labour</em>” (loc. cit., p. 68). 
“This is the principal error of the law of
appropriation…  <em>The evil lies in this
absolute lack of any bond</em> between the wage-worker and
the capital which is set in motion by his industry”
(p. 69).</p>
<p>This last phrase about “<em>bond</em>” is
written in the typical Sismondian manner and is quite silly
to boot.</p>
<p>About the <em>normal man [who is] equated with
capitalist</em>, etc., see op. cit., pp.  74 to 76.</p>
<p>About the <em>concentration of capitals</em> and the
elimination of the smaller capitalists (l.c.,
pp. 85-88).</p>
<p class="quote">“If in present circumstances real pro
fit derives from the thrift of the capitalists, it could
derive just as well from that of the wage earners”
(loc. cit., p. 89).</p>
<p>[On the other hand] <em>Cherbuliez</em> shares:</p>
<p>1).  [James] Mill’s view that all taxes should be
imposed only on rent (p. 128), but since it is impossible
“to impose a tax which is levied only on rent and
affects nothing but rent”, since it is difficult to
separate profit from rent and impossible when the landowner
is himself the cultivator, Cherbuliez proceeds to</p>
<p>2).  the real conclusion of the Ricardian
theory:</p>
<p class="quote">“Why do people not take a step
further and <em>abolish private ownership of land?</em>”
(p.  129) “The landowners are idlers who are
maintained at the public expense without any kind of benefit
to industry or to the general welfare of society”
(p. 129).  “What makes land productive is the
capital
<a name="tsv3p398">employed</a> in agriculture.  The landowner contributes
nothing to it.  He only exists to pocket rent, which
does not constitute a part of the profit on his capital,
neither is it the product of labour nor that of the
productive power of the soil, but the effect of the price of
the agricultural products, which is increased by the
competition of the consumers…” etc. (p.
129).  “Since the elimination of the private
ownership of band would in no way change the causes
responsible for rent, rent would continue to exist, but the
state would receive it, for all the land would belong to it
and it would lease out arable sections of the land to
private persons owning sufficient capital to exploit
them” (p. 130).  Rent would replace all state
revenues.  “Finally industry, liberated, released
from all fetters, would take an unprecedented leap
forward…” (p. 130).</p>
<p>But how does this Ricardian conclusion agree with the
pious Sismondian wish to place “bonds” on
capital and capitalist production?  How does it agree
with the lamentation:</p>
<p class="quote">“Capital will ultimately rule the
world if an upheaval does not halt the course which the
development of our society is taking under the domination of
the law of appropriation” (op. cit., p. 152). 
“Capital will eliminate the old social distinctions
everywhere in order to replace them by this simple
classification of men into rich and poor, the rich, who
enjoy themselves and rule, and the poor who work and
obey” (p. 153).  “The general appropriation
of <em>productive wealth and of the products</em> has always
reduced the numerous class of proletarians to a position of
subjugation and political impotence, but this appropriation
was once combined with a system of restrictive laws which,
by <em>impeding the development of industryand the
accumulation of capital</em> <span class="context">||1121|</span> , placed limits on the growth
of the class of the disinherited, restricted their civil
rights within narrow bounds and thus in different ways
rendered this class harmless.  Today, capital has
broken part of these fetters.  It is preparing to break
all of them” (pp.  155-56).</p>
<p class="quote">“The demoralisation of the
proletarians is the second result of the distribution of
wealth” (p. 156).</p>
