<p class="title">Theories of Surplus Value, Marx 1861-3</p>
<h1>[Chapter XIX]  Thomas Robert Malthus</h1>
<p><!-- TSV 3, p. 13 --><span class="context">||XIII-753|</span> The writings of Malthus
which have to be considered here are:</p>
<p>1)  <em>The Measure of Value Stated and Illustrated
etc</em>., London, 1823.</p>
<p>2)  <em>Definitions in Political Economy etc.</em>, London,
1827 (as well as the same work published by <em>John
Cazenove</em> in London in 1853 with Cazenove’s “Notes
and Supplementary Remarks”).</p>
<p>3)  <em>Principles of Political Economy
etc</em>., second ed., London, 1836 (first [edition] 1820 or
thereabout, to be looked up).</p>
<p>4)  Also to be taken into consideration the following work
by a Malthusian (i.e., a Malthusian in contrast to the
Ricardians)—<em>Outlines of Political Economy etc</em>.,
London, 1832.</p>
<h3>[1.  Malthus’s Confusion of the Categories
Commodity and Capital]</h3>
<p>In his <em>Observations on the Effects of the Corn Laws
etc.</em> (1814) Malthus still says the following about
Adam Smith:</p>
<p class="quote">“Adam Smith<a href="#-ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[a]</a> was evidently led
into this train of argument from his habit of considering
<em>labour</em>” (that is, the value of labour)
“as <em>the standard measure of value</em> and corn as
the measure of labour…  And that<a href="#-ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[b]</a> neither labour nor
any other commodity can be an accurate measure of real value
in exchange, is now considered as one of the most
incontrovertible doctrines of political economy; and indeed
follows, […] from the very definition of value in
exchange” [pp. 11-12].</p>
<p>But in his <em>Principles of Political Economy</em> (1820),
Malthus borrows this “standard measure of value”
from Smith to use it
<!-- TSV 3, p. 14 -->
against Ricardo, though Smith himself never used it when
he was really analysing his subject matter.  Malthus
himself, in his book on the <em>Corn Laws</em> already
referred to, adopted Smith’s other definition concerning the
determination of value by the quantity of capital
(accumulated labour) and (immediate) labour necessary for
the production of an article.</p>
<p>One cannot fail to recognise that both Malthus’s
<em>Principles</em> and the two other works mentioned, which
were intended to amplify certain aspects of the
<em>Principles</em>, were largely inspired by envy at the
success of Ricardo’s book and were an attempt by Malthus to
regain the leading position which he had attained by skilful
plagiarism before Ricardo’s book appeared.  In
addition, Ricardo’s definition of value, though somewhat
abstract in its presentation, was directed against the
interests of the landlords and their retainers, which
Malthus represented even more directly than those of the
industrial bourgeoisie.  At the same time, it cannot be
denied that Malthus presented a certain theoretical,
speculative interest.  Nevertheless his opposition to
Ricardo—and the form this opposition assumed—was
possible only because Ricardo had got entangled in all kinds
of inconsistencies.</p>
<p>The points of departure for Malthus’s attack are, on the
one hand, the origin of surplus-value and [on the other] the
way in which Ricardo conceives the equalisation of
cost-prices in different spheres of the employment of
capital as a modification of the law of value itself [as
well as] his continual confusion of profit with
surplus-value (direct identification of one with the
other).  Malthus does not unravel these contradictions
and <em>quid pro quos</em> but accepts them from Ricardo in
order to be able to overthrow the Ricardian law of value,
etc., by using this confusion and to draw conclusions
acceptable to his protectors.</p>
<p>The real contribution made by Malthus in his three books
is that he places the main emphasis on the <em>unequal</em>
exchange between capital and wage-labour, whereas Ricardo
does not actually explain how the exchange of commodities
according to the law of value (according to the labour-time
embodied in the commodities) gives rise to the unequal
exchange between capital and living labour, between a
definite amount of accumulated labour and a definite amount
of immediate labour, and therefore in fact leaves the origin
of surplus-value obscure (since he makes capital exchange
immediately for labour and not for labour power). 
<span class="context">||754|</span> <em>Cazenove</em>, one of
the few later disciples
<!-- TSV 3, p. 15 -->
of Malthus, realises this and says in his preface to
<em>Definitions etc</em>., mentioned above:</p>
<p class="quote"><em>Interchange of commodities</em> and <em>Distribution</em>
(wages, rent and profit) must be kept distinct from each
other … the Laws of Distribution are not altogether
dependent upon those relating to Interchange<a href="#-ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[c]</a> ([T.  R. Malthus, <em>Definitions in
Political Economy</em>, ed. by John Cazenove, London, 1853, ]
Preface, pp. <em>vi</em> and <em>vii</em>).</p>
<p>Here this can only mean that the relation of wages to
profit, the exchange of capital and wage-labour, of
accumulated labour and immediate labour, do not
<em>directly</em> coincide with the law of the interchange of
commodities.</p>
<p>If one considers the <em>utilisation</em> of money or
commodities as capital—that is, not their value but
their capitalist <em>utilisation—</em> it is clear that
<em>surplus-value</em> is nothing but the surplus of labour
(the unpaid labour) which is commanded by capital, i.e.,
which the commodity or money commands over and above the
quantity of labour it itself contains.  In addition to
the quantity of labour it itself contains (equal to the sum
of labour contained in the elements of production of which
it is made up, plus the immediate labour which is added to
them), it buys a surplus of labour which it does not itself
embody.  This surplus constitutes the surplus-value;
its size determines the rate of expansion of capital. 
And this surplus quantity of living labour for which it is
exchanged is the source of profit.  Profit (or rather
surplus-value) does not result from the exchange of an
amount of materialised labour for an equivalent amount of
living labour, but from the portion of living labour which
is appropriated in this exchange without an equivalent
payment in return, that is, from unpaid labour which capital
appropriates in this pseudo-exchange.  If one
disregards how this process is mediated—and Malthus is
all the more justified in disregarding it as the
intermediate link is not mentioned by Ricardo—if one
considers only the factual content and the result of this
process, then production of surplus-value, profit,
transformation of money or commodities into capital, arises
not from the fact that commodities are exchanged according
to the law of value, namely, in proportion to the amount of
labour-time which they cost, but rather conversely, from the
fact that commodities or money (i.e., materialised labour)
are
<!-- TSV 3, p. 16 -->
exchanged for <em>more</em> living labour than is embodied
or worked up in them.</p>
<p>Malthus’s sole contribution in the books mentioned is the
emphasis he places on this point, which emerges all the less
sharply in Ricardo as Ricardo always presupposes the
finished product which is divided between the capitalist and
the worker without considering exchange, the intermediate
process which leads to this division.  However, this
contribution is cancelled out by the fact that he confuses
the <em>utilisation</em> of money or the commodity as capital,
and hence its <em>value</em> in the specific function of
capital, with the <em>value of the commodity</em> as such;
consequently he falls back in his exposition, as we shall
see, on the fatuous conceptions of the Monetary System, on
profit upon expropriation, and gets completely entangled in
the most hopeless confusion.  Thus Malthus, instead of
advancing beyond Ricardo, seeks to drag political economy
back to where it was before Ricardo, even to where it was
before Adam Smith and the Physiocrats.</p>
<p class="quote">“…in the same country, and at
the same time, the exchangeable value of those commodities
which can be resolved into labour and profits alone, would
be accurately measured by the quantity of labour which would
result from adding to the accumulated and immediate labour
actually worked up in them the<a href="#-ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[d]</a> varying amount of the profits on all
the advances estimated in labour.  But this must
necessarily be the same as the quantity of labour which they
will command” ([T. R. Malthus,] <em>The Measure of
Value Stated and Illustrated</em>, London, 1823,
pp. 15-16).</p>
<p class="quote">“… the labour which a
commodity would command”<a href="#-ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[e]</a> [is] “a standard measure of
value” (op. cit., p. 61).</p>
<p class="quote">“… I had nowhere seen it
stated” (that is, before his own book <em>The Measure
of Value</em> appeared), “that the ordinary <em>quantity
of labour</em> which a commodity will command must represent
and measure <em>the quantity of labour worked up in it</em>,
with the addition of profits” ([T. R. Malthus,]
<em>Definitions in Political Economy etc</em>., London, 1827,
p. 196).</p>
<p>Mr. Malthus wants to include “profit”
directly in the definition of <em>value</em>, so that it
follows immediately from this definition, which is not the
case with Ricardo.  This shows that he felt where the
difficulty lay.</p>
<p>Besides, it is particularly absurd that he declares the
<em>value</em> of <em>the commodity</em> and its
<em>realisation</em> as capital to be identical.  When
commodities or money (in brief, materialised labour) are
<!-- TSV 3, p. 17 -->
exchanged as capital against living labour, they are
always exchanged against a <span class="context">||755|</span> greater quantity of labour
than they contain.  And if one compares the commodity
before this exchange on the one hand, with the product
resulting from this exchange with living labour on the
other, one finds that the commodity has been exchanged for
its own value (equivalent) plus a surplus over and above its
own value—the surplus-value.  But it is therefore
absurd to say that the value of a commodity is equal to its
value plus a surplus over and above this value.  If the
commodity, as a commodity, is exchanged for other
commodities and not as capital against living labour, then,
insofar as it is exchanged for an equivalent, it is
exchanged for the same quantity of materialised labour as is
embodied in it.</p>
<p>The only notable thing is therefore that according to
Malthus the profit exists already in the value of the
commodity and that it is clear to him that the commodity
always commands more labour than it embodies.</p>
<p class="quote">“…it is precisely because the
labour which a commodity will ordinarily command measures
the labour actually worked up in it with the addition of
profits, that it is justifiable to consider it”
(labour) “as a measure of value.  If then <em>the
ordinary value of a commodity</em> be considered as
determined by <em>the natural and necessary conditions of its
supply</em>, it is certain that the labour which it will
ordinarily command is alone the measure of these
conditions”([T. R. Malthus,] <em>Definitions in
Political Economy</em>, London, 1827, p. 214).</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>Elementary costs of
Production</em>.  An expression exactly equivalent to
the conditions […] of the supply”
(<em>Definitions in Political Economy</em>, ed.  by John
Cazenove, London, 1853, p.14).</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>Measure of the Conditions of</em>
[…] <em>the Supply</em> […].  The quantity
of labour for which the commodity will exchange, when it is
in its natural and ordinary state” (loc. cit.,
p. 14).</p>
<p class="quote">“… the quantity of labour
which a commodity commands represents exactly the quantity
of labour worked up in it, with the profits upon the
advances, and does therefore really represent and measure
those natural and necessary conditions of the supply, those
elementary costs of production which determine
value…” (op. cit., p. 125).</p>
<p class="quote">“… the demand for a commodity,
though not proportioned to the <em>quantity</em> of any other
commodity which the purchaser is willing and able to give
for it, is really proportioned to the <em>quantity of
labour</em> which he will give for it; and for this reason:
the <em>quantity of labour which a commodity will ordinarily
command</em>, represents exactly the effectual demand for it;
because it represents exactly <em>that quantity of labour and
profits united necessary to  effect its supply;</em> while
the <em>actual</em> quantity of labour which a commodity will
command when it differs from the <em>ordinary</em> quantity,
represents the excess or defect of demand arising from
temporary causes” (op. cit., p. 135).</p>
<p>Malthus is right in this also.  The conditions of
<em>supply</em>, i.e., of the production or rather the
reproduction of a commodity on
<!-- TSV 3, p. 18 -->
the basis of capitalist production, are that it or its
value (the money into which it is transformed) is exchanged
in the process of its production or reproduction for more
labour than is embodied in it, for it is only produced in
order to realise a profit.</p>
<p>For example, a cotton manufacturer sells his
calico.  The condition for the supply of new calico is
that he exchanges the money—the exchange-value of the
calico—for more labour in the process of the
reproduction of the calico than was embodied in it or than
is represented by the money.  For the cotton
manufacturer produces calico as a capitalist.  What he
wants to produce is not calico, but profit.  The
production of calico is only a means for the production of
profit.  But what follows from this?  The calico
he produces contains more labour-time, more labour than was
contained in the calico advanced.  This surplus
labour-time, this surplus-value, is also represented by a
surplus product, i.e., <em>more</em> calico than was exchanged
for labour.  Therefore one part of the product does not
replace the calico exchanged for labour, but constitutes
surplus product which belongs to the manufacturer.  Or,
if we consider the whole product, each yard of calico
contains an aliquot part, or its value contains an aliquot
part, for which no equivalent is paid; this represents
<em>unpaid</em> labour.  If the manufacturer sells a yard
of calico at its value, that is, if he exchanges it for
money or for commodities which contain an equal amount of
labour-time, he realises a sum of money, or receives a
quantity of commodities which cost him nothing.  For he
sells the calico not for the labour-time for which he has
paid, but for the labour-time embodied in the calico, and he
did not pay for part of this labour-time.  <span class="context">||756|</span> He receives, for example,
labour-time equal to 12 shillings, but he only paid 8
shillings of this amount.  When he sells it at its
value, he sells it for 12 shillings, and thus gains 4
shillings.</p>
<h3>[2.  Malthus’s Vulgarised View of
Surplus-Value]</h3>
<p>As far as the buyer is concerned, the assumption is that,
under all circumstances, he pays <em>nothing but</em> the
value of the calico.  This means that he gives a sum of
money which contains as much labour-time [as] there is in
the calico.  Three cases are possible.  The buyer
is a capitalist.  The money (i.e., the value of the
commodity) with which he pays, also contains a portion of
unpaid labour.  Thus, if one person sells unpaid
labour, the other person buys with unpaid labour.  Both
realise unpaid labour—One
<!-- TSV 3, p. 19 -->as seller, the other as buyer.  Or,
the buyer is an independent producer.  In this case he
receives equivalent for equivalent.  Whether the labour
which the seller sells him in the shape of commodities is
paid for or not, does not concern him.  He receives as
much materialised labour as he gives.  Or, finally, he
is a wage-worker.  In this case also, like every other
buyer—provided the commodities are sold at their
value—he receives an equivalent for his money in the
shape of commodities.  He receives as much materialised
labour in commodities as he gives in money.  But for
the money which constitutes his wages he has given more
labour than is embodied in the money.  He has replaced
the labour contained in it along with surplus labour which
he gives gratis.  He paid for the money above its
value, and therefore also pays for the equivalent of the
money, the calico, etc., above its value.  The cost for
him as purchaser is thus greater than it is for the seller
of any commodity although he receives an equivalent of the
money in the commodity; but in the money he did not receive
an equivalent of his labour; on the contrary, he gave more
than the equivalent in labour.  Thus the worker is the
only one who pays for all commodities above their value even
when he buys them at their value, because he buys money, the
universal equivalent, above its value for labour. 
Consequently, no gain accrues to those who sell commodities
to the worker.  The worker does not pay the seller any
more than any other buyer, he pays the value of
labour.  In fact, the capitalist who sells the
commodity produced by the worker back to him, realises a
profit on this sale, but only the same profit as he realises
on every other buyer.  His profit—as far as this
worker is concerned—arises not from his having sold
the worker the commodity <em>above</em> its value, but from
his having previously bought it from the worker, as a matter
of fact in the production process, <em>below</em> its
value.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Malthus, who transformed the utilisation of
commodities as capital into the value of commodities, quite
consistently transforms all buyers into wage-workers, in
other words he makes them all exchange with the capitalist
not commodities, but immediate labour, and makes them all
give back to the capitalist more labour than the commodities
<em>contain</em>, while conversely, the capitalist’s profit
results from <em>selling all</em> the labour contained in the
commodities when he has <em>paid</em> for only a portion of
the labour contained in them.  Therefore, whereas the
difficulty with Ricardo [arises from] the fact that the
law
<!-- TSV 3, p. 20 -->
of commodity exchange does not directly explain the
exchange between capital and wage-labour, but rather seems
to contradict it, Malthus solves the difficulty by
transforming the purchase (exchange) of commodities into an
exchange between capital and wage-labour.  What Malthus
does not understand is the difference between the total sum
of labour contained in a particular commodity and the sum of
paid labour which is contained in it.  It is precisely
this difference which constitutes the source of
profit.  Further, Malthus inevitably arrives at the
point of deriving profit from the fact that the seller sells
his commodity not only <em>above</em> the amount it costs
<em>him</em> (and the capitalist does this), but above what
<em>it costs;</em> he thus reverts to the vulgarised
conception of profit upon expropriation and derives
surplus-value from the fact that the seller sells the
commodity <em>above</em> its value (i.e., for more labour-time
than is contained in it).  What he thus gains as a
seller of a commodity, he loses as a buyer of another and it
is absolutely impossible to discover what profit is to be
made in reality from such a general nominal price
increase.  <span class="context">||757|</span> It is in
particular difficult to understand how society as a whole
can enrich itself in this way, how a real surplus-value or
surplus product can thus arise.  An absurd, stupid
idea.</p>
<p>Relying on some propositions of Adam Smith—who, as
we have seen, naïvely expresses all sorts of
contradictory elements and thus becomes the source, the
starting-point, of diametrically opposed
conceptions—Mr. Malthus attempts in a confused way,
though on the basis of a correct surmise, and of the
realisation of the existence of an unsolved difficulty, to
counterpose a new theory to that of Ricardo and thus to
maintain a “front rank” position.  The
transition from this attempt to the nonsensical, vulgarised
conceptions proceeds in the following way.</p>
<p>If we consider the utilisation of a commodity as
capital—that is, in its exchange for living,
productive labour—we see that it
commands—besides the labour-time it itself contains,
i.e., besides the equivalent reproduced by the
worker—surplus labour-time, which is the source of
profit.  Now if we transfer this <em>utilisation of the
commodity</em> to its <em>value</em>, then each purchaser of a
commodity must act as if he were a worker, that is, in
buying it, besides the quantity of labour contained in the
commodity, he must give for it a surplus quantity of
labour.  But since other purchasers, <em>apart from the
workers</em>, are <em>not</em> related to commodities as
workers &lt;even when the worker appears as a mere purchaser,
<!-- TSV 3, p. 21 -->
the old, original difference persists indirectly,
as we have seen&gt;, it must be assumed that although they
do not directly give more labour than is contained in the
commodities, they give a value which contains more labour,
and this amounts to the same thing.  It is by means of
this [quantity] of “surplus labour, or, what amounts
to the same thing, the value of more labour”, that the
transition is made.  In fact, it comes to this: the
value of a commodity consists of the value paid for it by
the purchaser, and this value is equal to the equivalent
(the value) of the commodity plus a surplus over and above
this value, surplus-value.  Thus we have the vulgarised
view that profit consists in a commodity being <em>sold more
dearly than it was bought</em>.  The purchaser buys it
for more labour or for more materialised labour than it
costs the seller.</p>
<p>But if the purchaser is himself a capitalist, a seller of
commodities, and his money, his means of purchase,
represents only goods which have been sold, then it follows
that both have sold their goods too dearly and are
consequently swindling each other, moreover they are
swindling each other to the same extent, provided they both
merely secure the average rate of profit.  Where are the
buyers to come from who will pay the capitalist the quantity
of labour equal to that contained in his commodity plus his
profit?  For example, the commodity costs the seller 10
shillings.  He sells it for 12 shillings.  He thus
commands labour not to the value of 10s. only, but of
2s. more. 
But the buyer also sells his commodity, which cost
l0s., for 12s. So that each loses as a buyer what he gained
as a seller. 
The only exception is the working class. 
For
since the price of the product is increased beyond its cost,
they can only buy back a part of that product, and thus
another part of the product, or the price of another part of
the product, constitutes profit for the capitalist. 
But as
profit arises precisely from the fact that the workers can
only buy back part of the product, the capitalist (the
capitalist class) can never realise his profit as a result
of demand from the workers, he cannot realise it by
exchanging the whole product against the workers’ wage, but
rather by exchanging <em>the whole</em> of the workers’ wage
against only part of the product. 
Additional demand and
additional buyers apart from the workers themselves are
therefore necessary, otherwise there could not be any
profit. 
Where do they come from? 
If they themselves are
capitalists, sellers, then the mutual swindling within the
capitalist class mentioned earlier occurs, since they
mutually
<!-- TSV 3, p. 22 -->
raise the nominal prices of their commodities and each
gains as a seller what he loses as a buyer. What is
<em>required</em> therefore are <em>buyers who are not
sellers</em>, so that the capitalist can realise his profit
and sell his commodities “at their value”. 
Hence the necessity for landlords, pensioners, sinecurists,
priests, etc., not to forget their menial servants and
retainers.  How these “purchasers” come
into possession of their means of purchase <span class="context">||758|</span> , how they must first take
part of the product from the capitalists without giving any
equivalent in order to buy back less than an equivalent with
the means thus obtained, Mr. Malthus does not explain. 
At any rate, what follows from this is his plea for the
greatest possible increase in the unproductive classes in
order that the sellers may find a market, a demand for the
goods they supply.  And so it turns out further that
the author of the pamphlet on population preaches continuous
over-consumption and the maximum possible appropriation of
the annual product by idlers, as a condition of
production.  In addition to the plea arising inevitably
out of this theory, comes the argument that capital
represents the <em>drive for abstract wealth, the drive to
expand its value</em>, which can only be put into effect by
means of a class of buyers representing the <em>drive to
spend, to consume, to squander</em>, namely, the unproductive
classes, who are buyers without being sellers.</p>
<h3>[3. The Row Between the Supporters of Malthus and
Ricardo in the Twenties of the 19th Century.  Common
Features in Their Attitude to the Working Class]</h3>
<p>There developed on this basis a fine old row between the
Malthusians and the Ricardians in the 20s (from 1820 to 1830
was in general the great metaphysical period in English
political economy). Like the Malthusians, the Ricardians
deem it necessary that the worker should not himself
appropriate his product, but that part of it should go to
the capitalist, in order that the worker should have an
<em>incentive for production</em>, and that the development of
wealth should thus be ensured.  But they rage against
the view of the Malthusians that landlords, state and church
sinecurists and a whole lot of idle retainers must first lay
hold—without any equivalent—of a part of the
capitalist’s product (just as the capitalist does in respect
of the workers) therewith to buy their own goods from the
capitalist with a profit for the latter, although this is
exactly what the Ricardians
<!-- TSV 3, p. 23 -->
affirm with regard to the workers. In order that
accumulation may increase and with it the demand for labour,
the worker must relinquish as much of his product as
possible gratis to the capitalist, so that the latter can
transform the net revenue, which has been increased in this
way, back again into capital.  The same sort [of
argument is used by] the Malthusians.  As much as
possible should be taken away gratis from the industrial
capitalists in the form of rent, taxes, etc., to enable them
to sell what remains to their involuntary
“shareholders” at a profit.  The worker
must not be allowed to appropriate his own product,
otherwise he would lose the incentive to work, say the
Ricardians along with the Malthusians.  The industrial
capitalist [the Malthusians say] must relinquish a portion
of his product to the classes which only
consume—<em>fruges consumere nati</em><a href="#-ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[f]</a>—in order that these in turn
may exchange it again, on unfavourable terms, with the
capitalist.  Otherwise the capitalist would lose the
incentive for production, which consists precisely in the
fact that he makes a big profit, that he sells his goods far
above their value.  We shall return to this comic
struggle later.</p>
<h3>[4. Malthus’s One-sided Interpretation of Smith’s Theory
of Value.  His Use of Smith’s Mistaken Theses in His
Polemic Against Ricardo]</h3>
<p>First of all, some evidence showing that Malthus arrives
at a very common conception:</p>
<p class="quote">“Whatever may be the number of
intermediate acts of barter which may take place in regard
to commodities—whether the producers send them to
China, or sell them in the place where they are produced:
the question as to an adequate market for them, depends
exclusively upon <em>whether the producers can replace their
capitals with ordinary profits</em>, so as to enable them
successfully to go on with their business. <em>But what are
their capitals?</em>  They are, as Adam Smith states, the
tools to work with, the materials to work upon, and the
means of commanding the necessary quantity of labour”
[<em>Definitions in Political Economy</em>, ed. by Cazenove,
London, 1853, p. 70].</p>
<p>(And this, he affirms, is all the labour worked up in the
commodity.  Profit is a <em>surplus</em> over and above the
labour expended in the production of the commodity.  In
fact, therefore, a nominal surcharge over and above the cost
of the commodity.) And in order that there may remain no
doubt about his meaning,
<!-- TSV 3, p. 24 -->
he quotes Colonel Torrens’s <em>On the Production of
Wealth</em> (Chap. VI, p. 349) approvingly as confirming his
own views:</p>
<p class="quote">“… effectual demand consists
in the power and inclination, on <em>the part of
consumers</em>” &lt;the antithesis of buyers and
sellers becomes that of consumers and producers&gt;, <span class="context">||759|</span> “to give for
commodities, either by immediate or circuitous barter, some
greater proportion of all ingredients of capital than their
production costs” ([R. Torrens, <em>An Essay on the
Production of Wealth</em>…  London, 1821, p. 349,
quoted by T. R. Malthus:] loc. cit., pp.  70-71).</p>
<p>And Mr. Cazenove himself, the publisher of, apologist for
and commentator on the Malthusian <em>Definitions</em>,
says:</p>
<p class="quote">“Profit does not depend on the
<em>proportion in which commodities are exchanged with each
other</em>”</p>
<p>&lt;for if commodity exchange between capitalists alone
were taken into account, the Malthusian theory, insofar as
it does not speak of exchange with workers, who have
<em>no</em> other commodity apart from their labour to
exchange with the capitalist, would appear nonsensical
[since profit would be] merely a reciprocal surcharge, a
nominal surcharge on the prices of their
commodities. Commodity exchange must therefore be
disregarded and people who produce <em>no</em> commodities
must exchange money&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“… (seeing that the same
proportion may be maintained under every variety of profit)
<em>but upon the proportion which goes to wages</em>, or is
required to cover the prime cost, and which is in all cases
determined by the degree in which the <em>sacrifice made by
the purchaser</em> (or the <em>labour’s worth which he
gives</em>) in order to acquire a commodity, <em>exceeds that
made by the producer, in order to bring it to
market</em>” (op. cit., p. 46).</p>
<p>In order to achieve these wonderful results, Malthus has
to make some very great theoretical preparations. First of
all, seizing on that side of Adam Smith’s theory according
to which the value of a commodity is equal to the quantity
of labour which it commands, or by which it is commanded, or
against which it exchanges, he must cast aside all the
objections raised by Adam Smith himself, by his followers
and also by Malthus, to the effect that the <em>value</em> of
a commodity—value [in general]— can be the
measure of value.</p>
<p><em>The Measure of Value Stated and Illustrated</em>
(London, 1823) is a real example of feeble-minded thought,
which winds its way in a casuistical and self-stupefying
manner through its own inner confusion, and whose difficult,
clumsy style leaves
<!-- TSV 3, p. 25 -->
the unprejudiced and incompetent reader with the
impression that the difficulty of making sense out of the
confusion does not lie in the contradiction between
confusion and clarity, but in a lack of understanding on the
part of the reader.</p>
<p>Malthus has first of all to obliterate Ricardo’s
differentiation between “value of labour” and
“quantity of labour” and to reduce Smith’s
juxtaposition of the two to the one false aspect.</p>
<p class="quote">“… any given <em>quantity of
labour</em> must be <em>of the same value as the wages</em>
which command it, or for which it actually exchanges”
(<em>The Measure of Value Stated and Illustrated</em>, London,
1823, p. 5).</p>
<p>The purpose of this phrase is to equate the expressions
“<em>quantity of labour</em>” and “<em>value
of labour</em>”.</p>
<p>This phrase itself is a mere tautology, an absurd
truism. Since <em>wages</em> or that “for which
it” (i.e., a quantity of labour)
“exchanges” constitute <em>the value</em> of this
quantity of labour, it is tautologous to say: <em>the
value</em> of a certain quantity of labour is equal to <em>the
wages</em> or to the amount of money or commodities for which
this labour exchanges.  In other words, this means
nothing more than: the exchange-value of a definite quantity
of labour is equal to its exchange-value—otherwise
called wages.  But (apart from the fact that it is not
labour, but labour-power, which exchanges directly for
wages; it is this confusion that makes the nonsense
possible) it by no means follows from this that a definite
quantity of labour is equal to the quantity of labour
embodied in the wages, or in the money or the goods which
represent the wages.  If a labourer works for 12 hours
and receives the product of 6 hours labour as wages, then
the product of the 6 hours constitutes the <em>value</em> of
12 hours labour (because the wages [represent] the
exchangeable commodity for [12 hours labour]).  It does
not follow from this that 6 hours of labour are equal to 12
hours, or that the commodities in which 6 hours of labour
are embodied [are] equal to the commodities in which 12
hours of labour are embodied.  It does not follow that
the value of wages is equal to the value of the product in
which the labour is embodied.  It follows only that the
value of labour (because it is measured by the value of the
labour-power, not by the labour carried out), the <span class="context">||760|</span> value of a given quantity of
labour contains less labour than it buys; that,
consequently, the <em>value of the commodities</em> in which
this purchased labour is embodied, is very different from
the value of the commodities
<!-- TSV 3, p. 26 -->
with which this given quantity of labour was purchased,
or by which it was commanded.</p>
<p>Mr. Malthus draws the opposite conclusion.  Since
the <em>value</em> of a given quantity of labour is equal to
its value, it follows, according to him, that the value in
which this quantity of labour is embodied is equal to the
value of the wages.  It follows further from this that
the immediate labour (that is, disregarding the means of
production) which is absorbed by and contained in a
commodity, creates no greater value than that which is paid
for it; [that it] only reproduces the value of the
wages.  The necessary consequence ensuing from this is
that profit cannot be explained if the value of commodities
is determined by the amount of labour embodied in them, but
must rather be explained in some other way; provided the
profit a commodity realises is to be included in the value
of that commodity.  For the labour worked up in a
commodity consists 1) of the labour contained in the
machinery, etc., used, which consequently reappears in the
value of the product; 2) of the labour contained in the raw
material used up.  The amount of labour contained in
these two elements before the new commodity is produced is
obviously not increased merely because they become
production elements of a new commodity.  There remains
therefore 3), the labour embodied in the wages which is
exchanged for living labour.  However, according to
Malthus, this latter is not greater than the materialised
labour against which it is exchanged.  Hence, a
commodity contains no portion of unpaid labour but only
labour which replaces an equivalent.  Hence it follows
that if the value of a commodity were determined by the
amount of labour embodied in it, it would yield no
profit.  If it does yield a profit, then this profit is
a <em>surplus</em> in the price over and above the labour
embodied in the commodity.  Therefore, in order to be
sold at its value (which includes the profit), a commodity
must command a quantity of labour equal to the quantity of
labour worked up in itself plus a surplus of labour
representing the profit realised in the sale of the
commodity.</p>
<h3>[5. Smith’s Thesis of the Invariable Value of Labour as
Interpreted by Malthus]</h3>
<p>Moreover, in order to make <em>labour</em>, not the
quantity of labour required for production, but labour as a
commodity, serve as a measure of value, Malthus asserts</p>
<!-- TSV 3, p. 27 -->
<p class="quote">“…<em>the constant value of
labour(The measure of Value</em>, p.29, note).</p>
<p>&lt;There is nothing original in this; it is a mere
paraphrase and further elaboration of a passage of <em>Adam
Smith’s</em> (l. I, ch. V, [<em>Recherches sur la nature et
les causes de la richesse des nations</em>,] éd. Garnier,
t, I, [Paris, 1802,] pp. 65-66).</p>
<p class="quote">“Equal quantities of labour, at all
times and places, may be said to be of equal value to the
labourer. In his ordinary state of health, strength, and
spirits; in the ordinary degree of his skill and dexterity,
he must always lay down the same portion of his ease, his
liberty, and his happiness.  The price which he pays
must always be the same, whatever may be the quantity of
goods which he receives in return for it.  Of these,
indeed, it may sometimes purchase a greater and sometimes a
smaller quantity; but it is their value which varies, not
that of the labour which purchases them.  At all times
and places, that is <em>dear</em> which it is difficult to
come at, or which it costs much labour to acquire; and that
<em>cheap</em> which is to be had easily, or with very little
labour.  Labour alone, therefore, never varying in its
own value, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which
the value of all commodities can at all times and places be
estimated and compared.”&gt; [<em>Wealth of
Nations</em>, Vol. I, p.  36.]<a href="#-ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[g]</a></p>
<p>&lt;Further, Malthus’s discovery—of which he is
very proud and which he claims he was the first to
make—namely, that value is equal to the quantity of
labour embodied in a commodity plus a quantity of labour
which represents the profit; [this discovery] seems likewise
to be quite simply a combination of two sentences from
Smith. (Malthus never escapes plagiarism.)</p>
<p class="quote">“The real value of all the different
component parts of price, it must be observed, is measured
by the quantity of labour which they can, each of them,
purchase or command. Labour measures the value, not only of
that part of the price which resolves itself into
<em>labour</em>, but of that which resolves itself into
<em>rent</em>, and of that which resolves itself into
<em>profit</em>” ( [<em>Wealth of Nations</em>, O.U.P.,
p. 55; Garnier,] t. I, l. I, ch. VI, p. 100).&gt;</p>
<p><span class="context">||761|</span> Malthus writes in
this context:</p>
<p class="quote">“In the former case of<a href="#-ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[h]</a> the demand for labour,
it appeared that the greater earnings of the labourer were
occasioned,<a href="#-ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[i]</a> not by a
rise in the value of labour but by a fall in the value of
the produce for which the labour was exchanged. And in the
[…] case of an abundance of labour […] the
small earnings of the labourer were occasioned by a rise in
the value of the produce, and not by a fall in the value of
[…] labour” (<em>The Measure of Value</em>,
[London, 1823,] p. 35) (cf. pp. 33-35).</p>
<p><!-- TSV 3, p. 28 -->
Bailey ridicules most excellently Malthus’s <em>proof</em>
that <em>the value of labour</em> is constant (Malthus’s
further demonstration, not that of Smith; [and] in general
the sentence [about] the invariable value of labour):</p>
<p class="quote">“In the same way any article might be
proved to be of invariable value; for instance, 10 yards of
cloth. For whether we gave £5 or £10 for the 10 yards,
the sum given would always be equal in value to the cloth
for which it was paid, or, in other words, of invariable
value in relation to cloth.  But that which is given
for a thing of invariable value, must itself be invariable,
whence the 10 yards of cloth must be of invariable value
… it is just the same kind of futility to call wages
invariable in value, because though variable in quantity
they command the same portion of labour, as to call the
<em>sum</em> given for a hat, of invariable value, because,
although sometimes more and sometimes less, it always
purchases the hat” ([Samuel Bailey,] <em>A Critical
Dissertation on the Nature, Measures, and Causes of
Value</em>… , London, 1825, pp.  145-47).</p>
<p>In the same work, Bailey bitingly derides the insipid,
impressive-sounding tables with which Malthus
“illustrates” his measure of value.</p>
<p>In his <em>Definitions in Political Economy</em> (London,
1827), in which Malthus gives full vent to his annoyance
over Bailey’s sarcasm, he seeks, amongst other things, to
prove the <em>invariable value of labour</em>, as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">“… there is one<a href="#-ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[j]</a> large class of
commodities, such as raw products, which in the progress of
society tends to rise<a href="#-ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[k]</a> as compared with labour […]
such as<a href="#-ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[l]</a>
manufactured articles, […] fall; it may not be far
from […] truth to say, that […] the average
mass of commodities which a given quantity of labour will
command in the same country, during the course of some
centuries, may not very essentially vary”
(<em>Definitions in Political Economy</em>… 
London, 1827, p. 206).</p>
<p>Malthus’s proof that a rise in the money price of labour
must lead to an all-round rise in the money price of
commodities is of just the same quality as his proof of the
invariable value of labour:</p>
<p class="quote">“… if the money wages of
labour universally rise, the value of money proportionally
falls; and when the value of money falls … the prices
of goods always rise” (op. cit., p. 34).</p>
<p>It has to be proved that, when the value of money
compared with labour falls, then the value of all
commodities compared
<!-- TSV 3, p. 29 -->
with money rises, or that the value of money, not
estimated in labour, but in the other commodities,
falls.  And Malthus proves this by presupposing it.</p>
<h3>[6.  Malthus’s Use of the Ricardian Theses of the
Modification of the Law of Value in His Struggle Against the
Labour Theory of Value]</h3>
<p><em>Malthus</em> bases his polemic against Ricardo’s
definition of value entirely on the principles advanced by
Ricardo himself, to the effect that variations<a href="#-ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[m]</a> in the exchangeable
values of commodities, independent of the labour worked up
in them, are produced by the different composition of
capital as resulting from the process of
circulation—different proportions of circulating and
fixed capital, different degrees of durability in the fixed
capitals employed, different returns of circulating
capitals. In short, on Ricardo’s confusing cost-price with
value and regarding the equalisation of cost-prices, which
are independent of the mass of labour employed in the
particular spheres of production, as modifications of value
itself, thereby throwing the whole principle
overboard.  Malthus seizes on these contradictions in
the determination of value by
labour-time—contradictions that were first discovered
and emphasised by Ricardo himself— not in order to
solve them but in order to relapse into quite meaningless
conceptions and to pass off the mere <em>formulation</em> of
contradictory phenomena, their expression in speech, as
their solution.  We shall see the same method employed
during the decline of the Ricardian school, i.e., by [James]
Mill and McCulloch, who, in order to reason the
contradictory phenomena out of existence, seek to bring them
into direct conformity with the general law by gabble, by
scholastic and absurd definitions and distinctions, with the
result, by the way, that the foundation itself vanishes.</p>
<p>The passages in which Malthus uses the material provided
by Ricardo against the law of value, and turns it against
him, are the following:</p>
<p class="quote">“It is observed by Adam Smith that
corn is an annual crop, butchers’ meat a crop which requires
four or five years to grow; and consequently, if we compare
two quantities of corn and beef which are of equal
exchangeable value, it is certain that a difference of three
or four additional years profit</p>
<!-- TSV 3, p. 30 -->
<p class="quote">at fifteen per cent upon the capital employed in the
production of the beef would, exclusively of any other
considerations, make up in value for a much smaller quantity
of labour, <span class="context">||762|</span> and thus we
might have two commodities of the same exchangeable value,
while the accumulated and immediate labour of the one was
forty or fifty per cent less than that of the other. This is
an event of daily occurrence in reference to a vast mass of
the most important commodities in the country; and if
profits were to fall from fifteen per cent to eight per
cent, the value of beef compared with corn would fall above
twenty per cent” (<em>The Measure of Value</em>,
pp. 10-11).</p>
<p>Since capital consists of commodities, and a large
proportion of the commodities which enter into it or
constitute it have a price (or exchange-value in the
ordinary sense) which consists neither of accumulated nor of
immediate labour, but—insofar as we are discussing
only this particular commodity—of a purely nominal
increase in the value caused by the addition of the average
profit, Malthus says:</p>
<p class="quote">“… labour is not the only
element worked up in capital” (<em>Definitions
etc</em>., ed. by John Cazenove, p. 29).</p>
<p class="quote">“… what are the <em>costs of
production?</em> … the quantity of <em>labour in kind
required to be worked up in the commodity</em>, and in the
tools and materials consumed in its production <em>with such
on additional quantity</em> as is equivalent to the ordinary
profits upon the advances for the time that they have been
advanced” (op. cit., pp. 74-75).</p>
<p class="quote">“On the same grounds Mr. Mill is
quite incorrect, in calling capital hoarded labour.  It
may, perhaps, be called <em>hoarded labour and profits;</em>
but certainly not hoarded labour alone, unless we determine
to call profits labour” (op. cit., pp. 60-61).</p>
<p class="quote">“To say that the values of
commodities are regulated or determined by the quantity of
Labour and Capital necessary to produce them, is essentially
false. To say that they are regulated <em>by the quantity of
Labour and Profits</em> necessary to produce them, is
essentially true” (op. cit., p. 129).</p>
<p>In this connection <em>Cazenove</em> adds a note on
p. 130:</p>
<p class="quote">“The expression Labour and Profits is
liable to this objection, that the two are not correlative
terms,—labour being an agent and profits a result; the
one a cause, the other a consequence. On this account <em>Mr.
Senior</em> has substituted for it the expression <em>Labour
and Abstinence</em>…  It must be acknowledged,
indeed, that it is not the abstinence, but the <em>use</em> of
the capital productively, which is the cause of
profits” (according to Senior: “He who converts
his revenue into capital, <em>abstains from the enjoyment</em>
which its expenditure would afford him”).</p>
<p>Marvellous explanation.  The value of the commodity
consists of the labour contained in it plus profit; [i.e.]
of the labour contained in it and the labour not contained
in it, but which must be paid for.</p>
<p>Malthus continues his polemic against Ricardo:
<!-- TSV 3, p. 31 -->
Ricardo’s “proposition, that as the value of wages
rises profits proportionably fall, cannot be true, except<a href="#-ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[n]</a> on the assumption
that commodities, which have the same quantity of labour
worked up in them, are always of the same value, an
assumption which probably will not be found to be true<a href="#-ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[o]</a> in one case out of
five hundred; and […] from that […] necessary
state of things, which,<a href="#-ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[p]</a> in the progress of civilisation and
improvement, tends continually to increase the quantity of
fixed capital employed, and to render more various and
unequal the times of the returns of the circulating
capital” (<em>Definitions etc</em>., pp. 31-32).</p>
<p>(The same point is made on pp. 53-54 in Cazenove’s
edition where Malthus actually says:</p>
<p class="quote">“…that<a href="#-ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[q]</a> natural […] state of things,
falsifies Ricardo’s measure of value because this state
“… in the progress of civilisation and
improvement, tends continually to increase the quantity of
fixed capital employed, and to render more various and
unequal the times of the returns of the circulating
capital”.)</p>
<p class="quote">“Mr. Ricardo […] himself
admits of considerable exceptions to his rule; but if we
examine the classes which come under his exceptions, that
is, where the quantities of fixed capital employed are
different and of different degrees of duration, and where
the periods of the returns of the circulating capital
employed are not the same, we shall find that they are so
numerous, that the rule may be considered as the exception,
and the exceptions the rule” (op. cit., p. 50).</p>
<h3>[7.  Malthus’s Vulgarised Definition of
Value.  His View of Profit as Something Added to the
Price.  His Polemic Against Ricardo’s Conception of the
Relative Wages of Labour]</h3>
<p>In accordance with what has been said above, Malthus also
declared value to be:</p>
<p class="quote">“The estimation in which a commodity
is held, founded upon its <em>cost to the purchaser</em> or
the <em>sacrifice</em> which he must make in order to acquire
it, which sacrifice is measured by the <em>quantity of labour
that he gives in exchange for it, or what comes to the some
thing</em>, by <em>the labour</em> which it will command”
(op. cit., pp. 8-9).</p>
<p>Cazenove also emphasises as a difference between Malthus
and Ricardo:</p>
<p class="quote"><span class="context">||763|</span>
“Mr. Ricardo has, with Adam Smith, adopted labour as
the true standard of cost; but he has applied it to
<em>producing</em> cost only…  it is equally
applicable as a measure of <em>cost to the
purchaser</em>…” (op. cit., pp. 56-57).


<p><!-- TSV 3, p. 32 -->
In other words: the value of a commodity is equal to the
sum of money which the purchaser must pay, and this sum is
best estimated in terms of the amount of ordinary labour
which can be bought with it.<a href="#-ftn18" name="_ftnref18">*</a> But what determines the sum of money
is, naturally, not explained.  It is the quite ordinary
idea of the matter that is prevalent in everyday life. 
A mere triviality expressed in high-flown language.  In
other words, it means nothing more than that
<em>cost-price</em> and <em>value</em> are identical, a
confusion which, in the case of Adam Smith, and still more
in the case of Ricardo, contradicts their real analysis, but
which Malthus elevates into a law.  It is the
conception of value held by the philistine who, being a
captive of competition, only knows the outward appearance of
value.  What then determines the cost-price?  The
capital outlay plus profit.  And what determines
profit?  Where do the funds for the profit come from,
where does the surplus product in which the surplus-value
manifests itself come from?  If it is simply a matter
of a nominal increase of the money price, then nothing is
easier than to increase the value of commodities.  And
what determines the value of the capital outlay?  The
<em>value</em> of the labour contained in it, says
Malthus.  And what determines this?  The
<em>value</em> of the commodities on which the wages are
spent.  And the value of these commodities?  The
value of the labour plus profit.  And so we keep going
round and round in a circle.  Granting that the worker
is in fact paid the value of his labour, that is, that the
commodities (or sum of money) which constitute his wages are
equal to the value of the commodities (or sum of money) in
which his labour is realised, so that if he receives 100
thaler in wages he also adds only 100 thaler of value to the
raw material, etc.—in short, to the capital
outlay—then profit can only arise from a surcharge
added by the seller over and above the <em>real</em> value of
the commodity.  All sellers do this.  Thus,
insofar as capitalists engage in exchange amongst
themselves, nobody gains from this surcharge, and least of
all is a surplus fund thus produced from which they can draw
their revenue.  Only the capitalists whose commodities
are consumed by the working class will make a real and not
an imaginary profit, by selling commodities back again to
the workers at a higher price than they paid the workers
for
<!-- TSV 3, p. 33 -->
them.  The commodities for which they paid the
workers 100 thaler will be sold back again to them for 110
thaler.  That means that they will only sell
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of the product back to the
workers and retain <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> for
themselves.  But what else does that mean but that the
worker who, for example, works for 11 hours, gets paid for
only 10 hours; that he is given the product of only 10
hours, while the capitalist receives one hour or the product
of one hour without giving any equivalent.  And what
does it mean but that profit—as far as the working
class is concerned—is made by their working for the
capitalists <em>for nothing</em> part of the time, that
therefore “the <em>quantity</em> of labour” does
not come to the same as “the value of
labour”.  The other capitalists however would
only he making an imaginary profit, since they would not
have this expedient.</p>
<p>How little Malthus understood Ricardo’s first
propositions, how completely he failed to comprehend that a
profit is possible in other ways than by means of a
surcharge is shown conclusively by the following
passage:</p>
<p class="quote">“Allowing that the first commodities,
if completed and brought into use immediately, might be the
result of pure labour, and that their value would therefore
be determined by the quantity of that labour; yet it is
quite impossible that such commodities <em>should be employed
as capital</em> to assist in the production of other
commodities, <em>without the capitalist being deprived of the
use of his advances for a certain period, and requiring a
remuneration in the shape of profits</em>.</p>
<p>In the early periods of society, on account of the
comparative scarcity of these advances of labour, this
remuneration would be high, and would affect the value of
such commodities to a considerable degree, owing to the high
rate of profits.  In the more advanced stages of
society, the value of capital and commodities is largely
affected by profits, on account of the greatly increased
quantity of fixed capital employed, and the greater length
of time for which much of the circulating capital is
advanced before the capitalist is repaid by the
returns.  In <em>both cases</em>, the <em>rate at which
commodities exchange with each other, is essentially
affected by the varying amount of profits”
(Definitions etc</em>., ed. by Cazenove, p. 60).</p>
<p>The concept of <em>relative</em> wages is one of Ricardo’s
greatest contributions.  It consists in this—that
the <em>value of the wages</em> (and consequently of the
<em>profit</em>) depends absolutely on the proportion of that
part of the working-day during which the <em>worker works for
himself</em> (producing or reproducing his wage) to that part
of his time which belongs to the capitalist.  This is
important economically, in fact it is only another way of
expressing the real theory of surplus-value.  It is
important further in
<!-- TSV 3, p. 34 -->
regard to the social relationship between the two <span class="context">||764|</span> classes.  Malthus smells
a rat and is therefore constrained to protest.</p>
<p class="quote">“No writer that I have met with,
anterior to Mr. Ricardo, ever used the term <em>wages</em>, or
real wages, as implying <em>proportions</em>.”</p>
<p>(Ricardo speaks of the <em>value</em> of wages, which is
indeed also presented as the part of the product accruing to
the worker.)</p>
<p><em>Profits</em>, indeed, imply proportions; and the
<em>rate of profits has always justly been estimated by a
percentage upon the value of the advances</em>.“</p>
<p>&lt;What Malthus understands by <em>value of advances</em>
is very hard, and for him even impossible, to say. 
According to him, the value of a commodity is equal to the
advances contained in it plus profit.  Since the
advances, apart from the immediate labour, also consist of
commodities, the value of the advances is equal to the
advances in them plus profit.  Profit thus equals
profit upon the advances plus profit.  And so on, <em>ad
infinitum.&gt;</em></p>
<p class="quote">“But wages had uniformly been
considered as rising or falling, not according to any
<em>proportion</em> which they might bear to the whole produce
obtained by a certain quantity of labour, but by the greater
or smaller quantity of any particular produce received by
the labourer, or by the greater or smaller power which such
produce would convey, of commanding the necessaries and
conveniences of life” (<em>Definitions etc</em>.,
London, 1827, pp. 29-30).</p>
<p>Since the production of <em>exchange-value—the</em>
increase of exchange-value—is the immediate aim of
capitalist production, it is important [to know] how to
measure it.  Since the value of the capital advanced is
expressed in money (real money or money of account), the
rate of increase is measured by the amount of capital
itself, and a capital (a sum of money) of a certain
size—100—is taken as a standard.</p>
<p class="quote">“Profits of stock,”<a href="#-ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[r]</a> says Malthus,
“… consist of the difference between the value
of the capital advanced, and the value of the commodity when
sold or used” (op. cit., pp. 240-41).</p>
<h3>[8.  Malthus on Productive Labour and
Accumulation]</h3>
<h4>[a)] Productive and Unproductive Labour</h4>
<p class="quote">“… Revenue […] is
expended with a view to immediate support and enjoyment, and
[…] capital […] is expended with a view to
profit” (op. cit., p. 86).</p>
<p class="quote">A labourer and a menial servant are “two
instruments […] used for purposes distinctly
different, one to assist in obtaining wealth, the other to
assist in consuming it” (op. cit., p. 94).</p>
<p><!-- TSV 3, p. 35 -->The following is a good definition
of the productive labourer.</p>
<p class="quote">The productive labourer <em>directly “increases<a href="#-ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[s]</a> his master’s
wealth” (Principles of Political Economy</em>, [second
ed., London, 1836], p. 47, note).</p>
<p>In addition the following passage should be noted.</p>
<p class="quote">“The only productive consumption,
properly so called, is the consumption or<a href="#-ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[t]</a> destruction of wealth by
capitalists with a view to reproduction…  The
workman whom the capitalist employs certainly consumes that
part of his wages which he does not save, as revenue, with a
view to subsistence and enjoyment; and not as capital, with
a view to production.  <em>He is a productive consumer
to the person who employs him</em> and to the state, <em>but
not, strictly speaking to himself” (Definitions</em>,

<h4>[b)] Accumulation</h4>
<p class="quote">“No political economist of the
present day can by <em>saving</em> mean mere hoarding; and
beyond this contracted and inefficient proceeding, no use of

materialised labour, objectified labour.)  “The<a href="#-ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[v]</a> labour worked up in

<em>accumulated labour</em>, as contra-distinguished from the
<em>immediate labour employed by the last
capitalist</em>” (op. cit., pp.  28-29).</p>
<p>It is indeed very important to make this
distinction.  In Malthus, however, it leads to
nothing.</p>
<p>He does make an attempt to reduce the surplus-value or at
least its rate (which, by the way, he always confuses with
profit and rate of profit) to its relation to variable
capital, that part of capital which is expended on
<em>immediate labour</em>.  This attempt, however, is
childish and could not be otherwise in view of his
conception of value.  In his <em>Principles of Political
Economy</em> [second ed,], he says:</p>
<p class="quote">Supposing that the capital is expended only on wages,
[if] “… a hundred pounds [is] expended in
immediate labour, […] the returns come in at the end
of the year […] £110, £120, or £130, it is evident
that in each case the profits will be <em>determined by the
proportion of the value of the whole produce which is
required to pay the labour employed</em>.  If the value
of the produce in [the] market be £110, the proportion
required to pay the labourers will be<a href="#-ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[x]</a> <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of the
value of the produce, and profits will be ten per
cent.  If the value of the produce be £120, the
proportion required to pay the labour employed will bed
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">12</sub>, and profits will be twenty per
cent.  If […] £130, the proportion required to
pay the labour advanced will be <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">13</sub>,
and profits will be thirty per cent.” [<em>Principles
of Political Economy</em>, London, 1836, p. 267.] Supposing
that “… the advances of the capitalist do not
consist of labour alone […] <em>the capitalist</em>
[…] <em>expects an equal profit upon all the parts of
the capital which he advances</em>.  Let us suppose that
a certain portion of the value of his advances, one-fourth
for instance, consists of the wages of immediate labour,
and<a href="#-ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[y]</a> three-fourths
consist of accumulated
<!-- TSV 3, p. 37 -->
labour and profits, with any additions which may arise
from rents, taxes or<a href="#-ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[z]</a> other outgoings […] it will
be<a href="#-ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[aa]</a> strictly true
that <em>the profits of the capitalist will vary with the
varying value of this one-fourth of the<a href="#-ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[bb]</a> produce compared with the quantity
of labour employed</em> […] a farmer<a href="#-ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[cc]</a> employs in the cultivation
[…]£2,000, £1,500 of which […] in seed, keep
of horses, wear and tear of his fixed capital, interest upon
his fixed and circulating capitals, rents, tithes, taxes,
etc. and £500 upon immediate labour, and […] the
returns […] at the end of the year are worth<a href="#-ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[dd]</a> £2,400 […]
the farmer’s profit will be £400, or twenty per cent.<a href="#-ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[ee]</a>  And it is
equally obvious that <em>if we took one-fourth of the value
of the produce, namely £600, and compared it with the amount
paid in the wages of immediate labour, the result would shew
exactly the same rate of profits</em>” (loc. cit.,
pp. 267-68).</p>
<p>Here Malthus lapses into Lord Dundrearyism.  What he
wants to do (he has an inkling that surplus-value, hence
profit, has a definite relation to variable capital, the
portion of capital expended on wages) is to show that
“profits” are “determined by the
proportion of the value of the whole produce which is
required to pay the labour employed” [loc. cit.,
p. 267].  He begins correctly insofar as he assumes
that the whole of the capital consists of variable capital,
capital expended on wages.  In this case, profit and
surplus-value are in fact identical.  But even in this
case he confines himself to a very silly reflection. 
If the capital expended equals 100 and the profit is 10 per
cent, the value of the product is, accordingly, 110 and the
profit is <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub> of the capital expended
(hence 10 per cent if calculated on the capital), and
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of the value of the total
product, in the value of which its own value is
included.  Thus profit constitutes
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of the value of the total product
and the capital expended forms <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>
of this value.  In relation to the total, 10 per cent
profit can be so expressed that the part of the value of the
total product which is not made up of profit amounts to
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of the total product; or, a
product of 110 which includes 10 per cent profit consists of
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> outlay, on which the profit is
made.  This brilliant mathematical effort amuses him so
much that he repeats the same calculation using a profit of
20 per cent, 30 per cent, etc.  But so far we have
merely a tautology.  The profit is a percentage on the
capital expended, the value of the total Product
<!-- TSV 3, p. 38 -->
includes the value of the profit and the capital
expended <span class="context">||766|</span> is the value of
the total product minus the value of the profit.  Thus
110-10=100.  And 100 is <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of
110.  But let us proceed.</p>
<p>Let us assume a capital consisting not merely of variable
but also of constant capital.  “… the
capitalist […] expects an equal profit upon all the
parts of the capital which he advances.” This however
contradicts the proposition advanced above that profit (it
should be called surplus-value) is determined by the
proportion of the capital expended on wages.  But never
mind.  Malthus is not the man to contradict either the
“expectations” or the notions of “the
capitalists”.  But now comes his <em>tour de
force</em>.  Assume a capital of £2,000, three-quarters
of which, or £1,500, is constant capital, one-quarter, or
£500, is variable capital.  The profit amounts to 20
per cent.  Thus the profit equals £400 and the value of
the product is £2,000 plus £400 =£2,400.  But what
about Mr. Malthus’s calculation?  If one takes a
quarter of the total product, it amounts to 600; a quarter
of the capital expended is equal to 500, which is equal to
the portion expended on wages; and 100, a quarter of the
profit, which equals that part of the profit falling to this
amount of wages.  And this is supposed to prove that
“the profits of the capitalist will vary with the
varying value of this one-fourth of the<a href="#-ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[ff]</a> produce compared with the quantity
of labour employed”.  It proves nothing more than
that a profit of a given percentage, e.g. of 20 per cent, on
a given capital—say of £4,000— yields a profit
of 20 per cent on each aliquot part of the capital, that is
a tautology, But it proves absolutely nothing about a
definite, <em>special</em>, distinguishing relationship of
this profit to the part of the capital expended on
wages.  If, instead of [<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub>]
taken by Mr.  Malthus, I take <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">24</sub> of
the total product, i.e., 100 (out of 2,400), then this 100
contains 20 per cent profit, or <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">6</sub> of
it is profit.  The capital would be [£] 83
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> and the profit [£1 16
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>.  If the 83
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> were equal, for instance, to a
horse which was employed in production, then it could be
demonstrated according to Malthus’s recipe that the profit
would vary with the varying value of the horse or the 28
<sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> part of the total product.</p>
<p>Such are the wretched things Mr. Malthus comes out with
when he stands on his own feet and cannot plagiarise
Townsend,
<!-- TSV 3, p. 39 -->
Anderson or anyone else.  What is really remarkable
and pertinent (apart from what is characteristic of the man)
is the inkling that surplus-value must be calculated on the
part of capital expended on wages.</p>
<p>&lt;Given a definite rate of profit, the <em>gross
profit</em>, the amount of profit, always depends on the size
of the capital advanced.  Accumulation, however, is
then determined by the part of this amount which is
reconverted into capital.  But this part, since it is
equal to the gross profit minus the revenue consumed by the
capitalist, will depend not only on the value of the total
profit, but on the cheapness of the commodities which the
capitalist can buy with it; partly on the cheapness of the
commodities which he consumes and which he pays for out of
his revenue, partly on the cheapness of the commodities
which enter into his constant capital.  Wages here are
assumed as given—since the rate of profit is likewise
assumed as given.&gt;</p>

<h3>[10.] Malthus’s Theory of Value [Supplementary
Remarks]</h3>
<p>The value of labour is supposed not to vary (derived from
Adam Smith) but only the value of the commodities I acquire
for it.  Wages are, say, two shillings a day in one
case, one shilling in another.  In the first case, the
capitalist pays out twice as many shillings for the same
labour-time as in the second.  But in the second case,
the worker performs twice as much labour for the same
product as in the first, since in the second case he works a
whole day for one shilling and in the first case only half a
day.  Mr. Malthus believes that the capitalist pays
sometimes more shillings, sometimes less, for the same
labour.  He does not see that the worker,
correspondingly, performs either less or more labour for a
given amount of produce.</p>
<p class="quote">“… giving more produce for a
given quantity of labour, or getting more labour for a given
quantity of produce, are one and the same thing in
his”(Malthus’s) “‘view’; in stead of
being, as one would have supposed, just the contrary”
(<em>Observations on Certain Verbal Disputes in Political
Economy, Particularly Relating to Value, and to Demand and
Supply</em>, London, 1821, p. 52).</p>
<p>It is stated very correctly in the same work
(<em>Observations on Certain Verbal Disputes etc.</em>) that
labour as a measure of value, in the sense in which Malthus
borrows it from Adam Smith, would be just as good a measure
of value as any other commodity and that it would not be so
good a measure as money in fact is.


<p><!-- TSV 3, p. 40 -->
Here it would be in general a question only of a measure
of value in the sense in which money is a measure of
value.</p>
<p><span class="context">||767|</span> In general, it is
never the <em>measure of value</em> (in the sense of money)
which makes commodities commensurable (see Part I of my
book, p. 45).</p>
<p class="quote">“On the contrary, it is only the
commensurability of commodities as materialised labour-time
which converts gold into money.”</p>
<p>Commodities as values constitute one <em>substance</em>,
they are mere representations of the same
substance—social labour.  The <em>measure of
value</em> (money) presupposes them as values and refers
solely to the expression and size of this value.  The
<em>measure of value</em> of commodities always refers to the
transformation of value into price and already presumes the
value.</p>
<p>The passage in the <em>Observations</em> alluded to reads
as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Malthus says: “‘In the <em>same</em> place,
and at the <em>same</em> time, the different quantities of
day-labour, which different commodities can command, will be
exactly in proportion to their relative values in
exchange’, and vice versa.  If this is true of
labour, it is just as true of anything else”
(op. cit., p. 49).  “Money does very well as a
measure at the same time and place…  But
it”(Malthus’s proposition) “seems <em>not</em> to
be true of labour.  Labour is not a measure even at the
same time and place.  Take a portion of corn, such as
is at the same time and place said to be of equal value with
a given diamond; will the corn and the diamond, paid in
specie, command equal portions of labour?  It may be
said […] No; but the diamond will buy <em>money</em>,
which will command an equal portion of labour … the
test is of no use, for it cannot be applied without being
<em>rectified</em> by the application of the other test, which
it professed to supersede.  We can only infer, that the
corn and the diamond will command equal quantities of
labour, <em>because</em> they are of equal value, in
money.  But we were told to infer that two things were
of equal value, because they would command equal quantities
of labour” (loc.  cit., pp. 49-50).</p>
<p><a name="vol32-p233"> </a></p>
<h3>[11.]  Over-Production, “Unproductive
Consumers”, etc.</h3>
<p>Malthus’s theory of value gives rise to the whole
doctrine of the necessity for continually rising
unproductive consumption which this exponent of
over-population (because of shortage of food) preaches so
energetically.  The value of a commodity is equal to
the value of the materials, machinery, etc., advanced plus
the quantity of direct labour which the commodity contains;
this, according to Malthus, is equal to the <em>value</em> of
the wages contained in the commodity, plus a profit
increment on these advances according to the general rate of
profit.  This nominal price increment represents the
profit and is a condition
<!-- TSV 3, p. 41 -->
of supply, and therefore of the reproduction of the
commodity.  These elements constitute the <em>price for
the purchaser</em> as distinct from the <em>price for the
producer</em>, and the price for the purchaser is the real
value of the commodity.  The question now
arises—how is this price to be realised?  Who is
to pay it?  And from what funds is it to be paid?</p>
<p>In dealing with Malthus we must make a distinction (which
he has neglected to make).  One section of capitalists
produce goods which are <em>directly</em> consumed by the
workers; another section produce either goods which are
<em>only indirectly</em> consumed by them, insofar, for
example, as they are part of the capital required for the
production of necessaries, as raw materials, machinery,
etc., or commodities which <em>are not consumed</em> by the
workers <em>at all</em>, entering only into the revenue of the
non-workers.</p>
<p>Let us first of all consider the capitalists who produce
the articles which are consumed by the workers.  These
capitalists are not only buyers of labour, but also sellers
of their own products to the workers.  If the quantity
of labour contributed by the worker is valued at 100 thaler
the capitalist pays him 100 thaler.  And this
[according to Malthus] is the only value added to the raw
material, etc., by the labour which the capitalist has
bought.  Thus the worker receives the value of his
labour and only gives the capitalist an equivalent of that
value in return.  But although the worker nominally
receives the value, he actually receives a smaller quantity
of commodities than he has produced.  In fact, he
receives back only a part of his labour materialised in the
product.  Let us assume for the sake of
simplicity—as Malthus does quite frequently—that
capital consists only of capital laid out in wages.  If
100 thaler are advanced to the worker in order to produce
commodities, and these 100 thaler are the <em>value</em> of
the labour purchased and the sole value which it adds to the
product—then the capitalist sells these commodities
for 110 thaler, and the worker, with his 100 thaler, can buy
back only <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of the product;
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> remains in the hands of the
capitalist, to the value of 10 thaler, or the amount of
surplus product in which this surplus-value of 10 thaler is
embodied.  If the capitalist sells the product for 120,
then the worker receives only <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">12</sub> of
the product and the capitalist <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">12</sub> of
the product and its value.  If he sells it for 130 (30
per cent), then the worker [receives] only
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">13</sub> and the capitalist
<sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">13</sub> of the product.  If he sells
it at 50 per cent profit, i.e., for 150, the worker
<!-- TSV 3, p. 42 -->
receives <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> and the <span class="context">||768|</span> capitalist
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> of the product.  The higher
the price at which the capitalist sells, the lower the share
of the worker, and the higher his own share in the value of
the product and therefore also in the quantity of the
product.  And the less the worker can buy back of the
value or of the product with the value of his labour. 
It makes no difference to the situation if, in addition to
variable capital, constant capital is also advanced, for
example, if, in addition to the 100 thaler wages, there is
another 100 for raw materials, etc.  In this case, if
the rate of profit is 10, then the capitalist sells the
goods for 220 instead of for 210 (namely, 100 constant
capital and 120 the product of [direct] labour).</p>
<p>&lt;<em>Sismondi’s Nouveaux Principes etc.</em> first
published in 1819.&gt;</p>
<p>Here, as regards the <em>class of capitalists A</em>, who
produce articles which are directly consumed by the
workers—necessaries, we have a case where as a result
of the nominal surcharge—the normal profit increment
added to the price of the advances—a surplus fund is
in fact created for the capitalist, since, in this
roundabout way, he gives back to the worker only a part of
his product while appropriating a part for himself. 
But this result follows not because he sells the entire
product to the worker at the increased value, but precisely
because the increase in the value of the product makes the
worker unable to buy back the whole product with his wages,
and allows him to buy back only part of it. 
Consequently, it is clear that demand by the workers can
never suffice for the realisation of the surplus of the
purchase price over and above the cost-price, i.e., the
realisation of the profit and the “value” of the
commodity.  On the contrary, a profit fund only exists
because the worker is unable to buy back his whole product
with his wages, and his demand, therefore, does not
correspond to the supply.  Thus capitalist A has in
hand a certain quantity of products of a certain value, 20
thaler in the present case, which he does not require for
the replacement of the capital, and which he can now partly
spend as revenue, and partly use for accumulation. 
N.B.  The extent to which he has such a fund in hand
depends on the value of the surcharge he adds over and above
the cost-price and which determines the proportions in which
he and the worker share the total product.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to the <em>class of capitalists B</em>, who
supply raw materials, machinery, etc., in short constant
capital, to class A.  The capitalists of class B can
sell <em>only</em> to class A, for they cannot sell their
products back to the workers who have nothing
<!-- TSV 3, p. 43 -->
to do with capital (raw material, machinery, etc.), or to
the capitalists who produce luxury goods (all goods which
are not necessaries and which are not commonly used by the
labouring class), or to the capitalists who produce the
constant capital required for the production of luxury
goods.</p>
<p>Now we have seen that, in the capital advanced by A, 100
is included as constant capital.  If the rate of profit
is 10 per cent, the manufacturer of this constant capital
has produced it at a cost-price of 90
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>, but sells it for 100 (90
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> : 9
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> = 100:10).  Thus he makes his
profit by imposing a surcharge on class A.  And thereby
he receives from their product of 220, his 100 instead of
only 90 <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>, with which, we will
assume, he buys immediate labour.  B does not by any
means make his profit from his workers whose product, valued
at 90 <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>, he cannot sell back to
them for 100, because they do not buy his goods at
all.  Nevertheless, they are in the same position as
the workers of A.  For 90 <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>
they receive a quantity of goods which has only nominally a
value of 90 <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>, for every part of
A’s product is made uniformly dearer, or each part of its
value represents a smaller part of the product because of
the profit surcharge.</p>
<p>(This surcharging can only be carried out up to a certain
point, for the worker must receive enough goods to be able
to live and to reproduce his labour-power.  If
capitalist A were to add a surcharge of 100 per cent and to
sell commodities which cost 200 for 400, the worker would be
able to buy back only a quarter of the product (if he
receives 100).  And if he needed half of the product in
order to live, the capitalist would have to pay him
200.  Thus he would retain only 100 (100 go to constant
capital and 200 to wages).  It would therefore be the
same as if he sold the commodity for 300, etc.)</p>
<p>B makes his profit fund not (directly) through his
workers, but through his sales to A.  A’s product not
only serves to realise his profit, but constitutes his own
profit fund.  It is clear that A cannot realise the
profit he makes on his workers by selling to B, and that B
cannot provide sufficient demand for his product (enabling
him to sell it at its value) any more than his own workers
can.  On the contrary, a retroaction takes place
here.  <span class="context">||769|</span> The more he
raises the profit surcharge, the greater, in relation to his
workers, is the portion of the total product which he
appropriates and of which he deprives B.</p>
<p>Capitalist B adds a surcharge of the same size as
A.  B pays his workers 90 <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>
thaler as he did before, although they get
<!-- TSV 3, p. 44 -->
less goods for this sum.  But if A takes 20 per cent
instead of 10 per cent, he [B] likewise takes 20 per cent
instead of 10 per cent and sells for 109
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> instead of 100.  As a
result, this part of the outlay increases for A.</p>
<p>A and B may even be considered as a single class. 
(B belongs to A’s expenditure and the more A has to pay to B
from the total product, the less remains for him.) Out of
the capital of 290 <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">1</sub>l, B owns 90
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> and A 200.  Between them
they expend 290 <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> and make a
profit of 29 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>.  B can never
buy back from A to the tune of more than 100 and this
includes his profit of 9 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>. 
As stated, both of them together have a revenue of 29
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>.</p>
<p>As far as <em>classes C and D</em> are concerned, C being
the capitalists who produce the constant capital necessary
for the production of luxuries, and D being those who
directly produce the luxuries, in the first place it is
clear that the immediate demand for C is only formed by
D.  D is the purchaser of C.  And C can only
realise profit if he sells his goods to D too dearly by
means of a nominal surcharge over and above the
cost-price.  D must pay C more than is necessary for C
to replace all the constituent parts [of the cost-price] of
his commodities.  D for his part makes a profit
surcharge partly on the advances made by C and partly on the
capital expended directly on wages by D.  From the
profits which C makes out of D, he can buy some of the
commodities made by D, although he cannot expend all his
profit in this way, for he also needs necessaries for
himself, and not only for workers for whom he exchanges the
capital realised from D.  In the first place, the
realisation of the commodities by C depends directly on
their sale to D; secondly, after that sale is effected, the
value of the commodities sold by D cannot be realised as a
result of the demand arising from C’s profit, any more than
the total value of A’s commodities can be realised as a
result of the demand coming from B.  For the profit
made by C is made out of D, and if C spends it again on
commodities made by D instead of on others, his demand can
still never be greater than the profit he makes out of
D.  It must always be much smaller than D’s capital,
than his total demand, and it never constitutes a source of
profit for D (the most he can do is a little swindling of C
by means of the surcharge on the goods he sells back to him)
for C’s profit comes straight out of D’s pocket.</p>
<p>Further it is clear that, insofar as the
capitalists—whether of class C or of D—mutually
sell each other goods within each
<!-- TSV 3, p. 45 -->
class, nobody gains anything or realises a profit
thereby.  A certain capitalist, M, sells to N for 110
thaler goods which cost only 100, but N does the same to
M.  After the exchange as before, each of them owns a
quantity of goods the cost-price of which is 100.  For
110 thaler each receives goods which cost only 100. 
The surcharge gives him no greater command over the goods of
the other seller than it gives the other over his.  And
as far as value is concerned, it would be the same as if
every M and N were to give himself the pleasure of baptising
his commodities 110 instead of 100 without exchanging them
at all.</p>
<p>It is clear further that [according to Malthus] the
nominal surplus-value in D (for C is included in it) does
not constitute real surplus product.  The fact that the
worker receives less necessaries for 100 thaler because of
the surcharge imposed by A can, at first, be a matter of
indifference to D.  He has to expend 100 as he did
before in order to employ a certain number of workers. 
He pays the workers the value of their labour and they add
nothing more to the product, they only give him an
equivalent.  He can obtain a surplus over and above
this equivalent only by selling to a third person and by
selling his commodity above the cost-price.</p>
<p>In reality, the product of a mirror manufacturer [D]
contains both surplus-value and surplus product just as that
of the farmer.  For his product contains unpaid labour
(surplus-value) and this unpaid labour is embodied in the
product just as much as is the paid labour.  It is
embodied in surplus product.  One part of the mirrors
costs him nothing although it has value, because labour is
embodied in it in exactly the same way as in that part of
the mirrors which replaces the capital advanced.  This
surplus-value exists as surplus product <em>before</em> the
sale of the mirrors and is not [brought into being] only
through this sale.  If, on the contrary, the worker by
his immediate labour had only provided an equivalent for the
accumulated labour which he received in the form of wages,
then neither <span class="context">||770|</span> the surplus
product nor the surplus-value corresponding to it would
exist.  But according to Malthus, who declares that the
worker only gives back an equivalent, things are
different.</p>
<p>It is clear that class D (including C) cannot
artificially create for itself a surplus fund in the same
way as class A, namely, [by ] selling their commodities back
to the workers at a higher price than the workers were paid
for producing them, thus appropriating part of the total
product after replacing the capital
<!-- TSV 3, p. 46 -->
expended.  For the workers are not buyers of the
goods made by D.  No more can the surplus fund of this
class [arise] from the sale of commodities or their mutual
exchanges among the different capitalists of this
class.  It can be achieved only by the sale of their
product to class A and to class B.  [Because] the
capitalists of class D sell commodities worth 100 thaler for
110, capitalist A can buy only <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>
of their product for 100 thaler and they retain
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of their output, which they can
either consume themselves or exchange for commodities
produced by other members of their own class D.</p>
<p>[According to Malthus] things happen in the following way
to all capitalists who do not themselves directly produce
necessaries and therefore do not sell back to the workers
the major, or at least a significant, portion of their
products.</p>
<p>Let us say that their constant capital is 100.  If
the capitalist pays another 100 in wages, he is paying the
workers the value of their labour.  To this 100 the
workers add a value of 100, and the total value (the
cost-price) of the product is therefore 200.  Where
then does the profit come from?  If the average rate of
profit is 10 per cent, then the capitalist sells goods worth
200 for 220.  If he really sells them for 220, then it
is clear that 200 is sufficient for their
reproduction—100 for raw materials, etc., 100 for
wages, and he pockets 20, which he can dispose of as revenue
or use to accumulate capital.</p>
<p>But to whom does he sell the commodities at 10 per cent
above their “production value”, which, according
to Malthus, is different from the “market value”
or real value, so that profit, in fact, is equal to the
difference between production value and sale value, equal to
sale value minus production value?  These capitalists
cannot realise any profit through exchange or sale amongst
themselves.  If A sells B for 220 commodities worth
200, then B plays the same trick on A.  The fact that
these goods change hands does not alter either their value
or their quantity.  The quantity of goods which
belonged formerly to A is now in the possession of B, and
vice versa.  The fact that what was previously 100 is
now called 110, makes no difference.  The purchasing
power either of A or of B has in no way altered.</p>
<p>But, according to the hypothesis, these capitalists
cannot sell their goods to the workers.</p>
<p>They must, therefore, sell them to the capitalists who
produce necessaries.  These, indeed, have a real
surplus fund at their disposal resulting from their exchange
with the workers.


<p><!-- TSV 3, p. 47 -->
The creation of a nominal surplus-value has, in fact,
placed surplus product in their possession.  And this
is the only surplus fund which has existed up to now. 
The other capitalists can only acquire a surplus fund by
selling their goods above their production value to those
capitalists who possess a surplus fund.</p>
<p>As for the capitalists who produce the constant capital
required for the production of necessaries, we have already
seen that the producer of necessaries must perforce buy from
them.  These purchases enter into his production
costs.  The higher his profit, the dearer are the
advances to which the same rate of profit is added.  If
he sells at 20 per cent instead of at 10 per cent, then the
producer of his constant capital likewise adds 20 per cent
instead of 10 per cent.  And instead of demanding 100
for 90 <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>, he demands 109
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> or, in round figures, 110, so
that the value of the product is now 210, 20 per cent of
which is 42, so that the value of the whole product is
252.  Out of this the worker receives 100.  The
capitalist now receives more than <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>
of the total product as profit, whereas previously he
received only <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> when he sold the
product for 220.  The total amount of the product has
remained the same, but the portion at the disposal of the
capitalist has increased both in value and in quantity.</p>
<p>As for those capitalists who produce neither necessaries
nor the capital required for their production, their profit
[can] only be made by sales to the first two classes of
capitalists.  If the latter take 20 per cent, then the
other capitalists will take [the same].</p>
<p>[Exchange by] the first class of capitalists and exchange
between the two classes of capitalists are, however, two
very different things.  [As a result of exchange] with
the workers, the first class has established a real surplus
fund of necessaries (surplus product) which [as an
increment] of capital is in their hands to dispose of, so
that they can accumulate part of it and [spend] part of it
[as revenue] either on necessaries or on luxuries. 
Surplus-value here, in fact, [represents] <span class="context">||XIV-771|</span> surplus labour and surplus
product, although this is achieved [according to Malthus] by
the clumsy, roundabout method of a surcharge on
prices.  Let us assume that the value of the product of
the workers producing necessaries is, in fact, only equal to
100.  Since, however, <sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of
this is sufficient to pay the wages, it follows that the
capitalist only needs to spend 90
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>, upon which he makes a profit of
9 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>.  But if he pays the
workers
<!-- TSV 3, p. 48 -->
100 thaler and sells them the product for 110, under
the illusion that value of labour and quantity of labour are
identical, he still retains <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of
the product as he did previously.  The fact that this
is now worth 10 thaler instead of 9
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> represents no gain for him, for
he has now advanced 100 thaler as capital, not 90
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>.</p>
<p>But as far as the other classes of capitalists are
concerned, they have no real surplus product, nothing in
which surplus labour-time is embodied.  They sell the
product of labour worth 100 for 110 and merely by the
addition of a surcharge this capital is supposed to be
transformed into capital plus revenue.</p>
<p>But how stands the case now, as Lord Dundreary would say,
between these two classes of capitalists?</p>
<p>The producers of necessaries sell surplus product valued
at 100 for 110 (because they paid 100 in wages instead of 90
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>).  But they are the only
ones who have surplus product in their possession.  If
the other capitalists likewise sell them products valued at
100 for 110, then they do in fact replace their capital and
make a profit.  Why?  Because necessaries to the
value of 100 suffice for them to pay their workers, they can
therefore keep 10 for themselves.  Or rather because
they in fact receive necessaries to the value of 100, but
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub> of this is sufficient to pay
their workers, since they are in the same position as
capitalists in classes A and B.  These, on the other
hand, receive in return only an amount of produce
representing a value of 100.  The fact that its nominal
cost is 110 is of no significance to them, for it neither
embodies a greater amount quantitatively, as use-value, than
was produced by the labour-time the 100 thaler contain, nor
can it add 10 [thaler] to a capital of 100.  This would
be only possible if the commodities were resold.</p>
<p>Although the capitalists of both classes sell to one
another for 110 commodities worth 100, only in the hands of
the second class has 100 really the significance of
110.  In actual fact, the capitalists of the first
class only receive the value of 100 for 110.  And they
only sell their surplus product for a higher price because
for the articles on which they spend their revenue they have
to pay <em>more</em> than they are worth.  In fact,
however, the surplus-value realised by the capitalists of
the second class is limited only to a share in the surplus
product realised by the first class, for they themselves do
not create any surplus product.</p>
<p>In connection with this increased cost of luxuries, it
occurs just in time to Malthus that accumulation and not
expenditure
<!-- TSV 3, p. 49 -->
is the immediate object of capitalist production. 
As a result of this unprofitable trade, in the course of
which the capitalists of class A lose a portion of the
fruits wrung out of the workers , they are compelled to
moderate their demand for luxuries.  But if they do so,
and increase their accumulation, then effective demand
falls, the market for the necessaries they produce shrinks,
and this market cannot expand to its full extent on the
basis of the demand on the part of the workers and the
producers of constant capital.  This leads to a fall in
the price of necessaries, but it is only through a rise of
these prices, through the nominal surcharge on
them—and in proportion to this surcharge—that
the capitalists of class A are able to extract surplus
product from the workers.  If the price were to fall
from 120 to 110, then their surplus product (and their
surplus-value) would fall from <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">12</sub> to
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">11</sub>, and consequently the market, the
demand for the commodities offered by the producers of
luxuries, would decline as well, and by a still greater
proportion.</p>
<p>In the course of exchange with the second class, the
first class sells real surplus product after having replaced
its capital.  The second class, on the other hand,
merely sells its capital in order to turn its capital into
capital plus revenue by this trade.  The whole of
production is thus only kept going (and this is especially
the case with regard to its expansion) by means of
<em>increasing the prices of necessaries;</em> to this,
however, would correspond a price for luxuries in inverse
proportion to the amount of luxuries actually
produced.  Class II, which sells for 110 goods of the
value of 100, likewise does not gain by this exchange. 
For in actual fact, the 110 which it gets back is also only
worth 100.  But this 100 (in necessaries) replaces
capital plus profit, while the other 100 [in luxuries] is
merely called 110.  Thus [it would] amount to class I
receiving luxuries to the value of 100.  It buys for
110 luxuries to the value of 100.  For the other class,
however, 110 is worth 110, because it pays 100 for the
labour (thus replacing its capital) and therefore retains a
surplus of 10.</p>
<p><span class="context">||772|</span> It is difficult to
understand how any profit at all can be derived if those who
engage in mutual exchange sell their commodities by
overcharging one another at the same rate and cheating one
another in the same proportion.</p>
<p>This incongruity would be remedied if, in addition to
exchange by one class of capitalists with its workers and
the mutual exchange between the capitalists of the different
classes, there also existed a <em>third class of
purchasers</em>—a <em>deus ex machina</em>—a
<!-- TSV 3, p. 50 -->
class which paid the nominal value of commodities without
itself selling any commodities, without itself playing the
same trick in return; that is a class which transacted one
phase only: M—C, but not M—C—M; [a class]
which bought not in order to get its capital back plus a
profit, but in order to consume the commodities: a class
which bought without selling.  In this case the
capitalists would realise a profit not by exchange amongst
themselves but 1) by exchange between them and the workers,
by selling back to them a portion of the total product for
the same amount of money as they paid the workers for the
total product (after deducting the constant capital) and 2)
from the portion of luxuries as well as necessaries sold to
the third sort of purchaser.  Since these pay 110 for
100 without selling 100 for 110 in their turn, a profit of
10 per cent would be made in actual fact and not simply
nominally.  The profit would be made in dual fashion by
selling as little as possible of the total product back to
the workers and as much as possible to the third class, who
pay ready money, who, without themselves selling, buy in
order to consume.</p>
<p>But buyers who are not at the same time sellers, must be
consumers who are not at the same time producers, that is
<em>unproductive consumers</em>, and it is this class of
unproductive consumers which, according to Malthus, solves
the problem.  But these unproductive consumers must, at
the same time, be consumers able to pay, constituting real
demand, and the money they possess and spend annually must,
moreover, suffice to pay not only the production value of
the commodities they buy and consume, but also the nominal
profit surcharge, the surplus-value, the difference between
the market value and the production value.  This class
will represent consumption for consumption’s sake in
society, in the same way as the capitalist class represents
production for production’s sake, the one representing
“the passion for expenditure”, the other
“the passion for accumulation” (see
<em>Principles of Political Economy</em>, [second ed.,]
p. 326).  The urge for accumulation is kept alive in
the capitalist class by the fact that their returns are
constantly larger than their outlays, and profit is indeed
the stimulus to accumulation.  In spite of this
enthusiasm for accumulation, they are not driven to
over-production, or at least, not at all easily, since the
<em>unproductive consumers</em> not only constitute a gigantic
outlet for the products thrown on to the market, but do not
themselves throw any commodities on to the market, and
therefore, no matter
<!-- TSV 3, p. 51 -->
how numerous they may be, they constitute no
competition for the capitalists, but, on the contrary, all
represent demand without supply and thus help to make up for
the preponderance of supply over demand on the part of the
capitalists.</p>
<p>But where do the annual financial resources of this class
come from?  There are, in the first place, the
<em>landed proprietors</em>, who collect a great part of the
value of the annual product under the title of rent and
spend the money thus taken from the capitalists in consuming
the goods produced by the capitalists, in the purchase of
which they are cheated.  These landed proprietors do
not have to engage in production and do not on the average
do so.  It is significant, that insofar as they spend
money on labour, they do not employ productive workers but
<em>menial servants</em>, mere fellow-consumers of their
fortune, who help to keep the prices of necessaries up,
since they buy without helping to increase their supply or
the supply of any other kind of commodity.  But these
landed proprietors do not suffice to create “an
adequate demand”.  Artificial means must be
resorted to.  These consist of heavy <em>taxation</em>,
of a mass of sinecurists in State and Church, of large
armies, pensions, tithes for the priests, an impressive
national debt, and from time to time, expensive wars. 
These are the “remedies” (<em>Principles of
Political Economy</em>, [second ed.,] p. 408 et seq.).</p>
<p>The third class, proposed by Malthus as a
“remedy”, the class which buys without selling
and consumes without producing, thus receives first of all
an important part of the value of the annual product
<em>without paying for it</em> and enriches the producers by
the fact that the latter must first of all advance the third
class money gratis for the purchase of their commodities, in
order to draw it back again <span class="context">||773|</span> by selling the third class
commodities above their value, or by receiving more value in
money than is embodied in the commodities they supply to
this class.  And this transaction is repeated every
year.</p>
<h3>[12.  The Social Essence of Malthus’s Polemic
Against Ricardo.  Malthus’s Distortion of Sismondi’s
Views on the Contradictions in Bourgeois Production]</h3>
<p>Malthus correctly draws the conclusions from his basic
theory of value.  But this theory, for its part, suits
his purpose remarkably well—an apologia for the
existing state of affairs in England, for landlordism,
“State and Church”, pensioners,
<!-- TSV 3, p. 52 -->
tax-gatherers, tenths, national debt, stock-jobbers,
beadles, parsons and menial servants (“national
expenditure”) assailed by the Ricardians as so many
useless and superannuated drawbacks of bourgeois production
and as nuisances.  For all that, Ricardo championed
bourgeois production insofar as it [signified] the most
unrestricted development of the social productive forces,
unconcerned for the fate of those who participate in
production, be they capitalists or workers.  He
insisted upon the <em>historical</em> justification and
necessity of this stage of development.  His very lack
of a historical sense of the past meant that he regarded
everything from the historical standpoint of his time. 
Malthus also wishes to see the freest possible development
of capitalist production, however only insofar as the
condition of this development is the poverty of its main
basis, the working classes, but at the same time he wants it
to adapt itself to the “consumption needs” of
the aristocracy and its branches in State and Church, to
serve as the material basis for the antiquated claims of the
representatives of interests inherited from feudalism and
the absolute monarchy.  Malthus wants bourgeois
production as long as it is not revolutionary, constitutes
no historical factor of development but merely creates a
broader and more comfortable material basis for the
“old” society.</p>
<p>On the one hand, therefore, [there is] the working class,
which, according to the population principle, is always
redundant in relation to the means of life available to it,
over-population arising from under-production; then [there
is ] the capitalist class, which, as a result of this
population principle, is always able to sell the workers’
own product back to them at such prices that they can only
obtain enough to keep body and soul together; then [there is
] an enormous section of society consisting of parasites and
gluttonous drones, some of them masters and some servants,
who appropriate, partly under the title of rent and partly
under political titles, a considerable mass of wealth gratis
from the capitalists, whose commodities they pay for above
their value with money extracted from these same
capitalists; the capitalist class, driven into production by
the urge for accumulation, the economically unproductive
sections representing prodigality, the mere urge for
consumption.  This is moreover [advanced as] the only
way to avoid over-production, which exists alongside
over-population in relation to production.  The best
remedy for both [is declared to be] over-consumption by the
classes standing outside production.  The
<!-- TSV 3, p. 53 -->
disproportion between the labouring population and
production is eliminated by part of the product being
devoured by non-producers and idlers.  The
disproportion arising from over-production by the
capitalists [is eliminated] by means of over-consumption by
the owners of wealth.</p>
<p>We have seen how childishly weak, trivial and meaningless
Malthus is when, basing himself on the weak side of Adam
Smith, he seeks to construct a counter-theory to Ricardo’s
theory, which is based on Adam Smith’s stronger sides. 
One can hardly find a more comical exertion of impotence
than Malthus’s book on value.  However, as soon as he
comes to practical conclusions and thereby once again enters
the field which he occupies as a kind of economic Abraham a
Santa Clara, he is quite at his ease.  For all that, he
does not abandon his innate plagiarism even here.  Who
at first glance would believe that Malthus’s <em>Principles
of Political Economy</em> is simply the Malthusianised
translation of Sismondi’s <em>Nouveaux Principes
d’économie politique?</em> But this is the case. 
Sismondi’s book appeared in 1819.  A year later,
Malthus’s English caricature of it saw the light of
day.  Once again, with Sismondi, as previously with
Townsend and Anderson, he found a theoretical basis for one
of his stout economic pamphlets, in the production of which,
incidentally, he also turned to advantage the new theories
learned from Ricardo.</p>
<p><span class="context">||774|</span> While Malthus
assailed in Ricardo that tendency of capitalist production
which is revolutionary in relation to the old society, he
took, with unerring parsonical instinct, only that out of
Sismondi which is reactionary in relation to capitalist
production and modern bourgeois society.</p>
<p>I exclude Sismondi from my historical survey here because
a critique of his views belongs to a part of my work dealing
with the real movement of capital (competition and credit)
which I can only tackle after I have finished this book.</p>
<p>Malthus’s adaptation of Sismondi’s views can easily be
seen from the heading of one of the chapters in the
<em>Principles of Political Economy:</em></p>
<p class="quote">“Of the Necessity of a Union of the
Powers of Production with the Means of Distribution, in
order to ensure a continued Increase of Wealth”
([second ed.,] p. 361).</p>
<p>[In this chapter it is stated:]</p>
<p class="quote">“… the powers of production
[…] not alone […] secure the creation of a
proportionate degree of wealth.  Something else seems
to be necessary in order to call these powers fully into
action.  This is an effectual and unchecked
<!-- TSV 3, p. 54 -->
demand for all that is produced.  And what
appears to contribute most to the attainment of this object,
is, such a <em>distribution of produce</em>, and such an
adaptation of this produce to the wants of those who are to
consume it, as constantly to increase the exchangeable value
of the whole mass” (<em>Principles of Political
Economy</em>, [second ed.,] p. 361).</p>
<p>Furthermore, written in the same Sismondian manner and
directed against Ricardo:</p>
<p class="quote">“… the <em>wealth</em> of a
country depends partly upon the <em>quantity of produce</em>
obtained by its labour, and partly upon such an adaptation
of this quantity to the wants and powers of the existing
population as is calculated to give it <em>value</em>. 
Nothing can be more certain than that it is not determined
by either of them alone” (op. cit., p. 301).</p>
<p class="quote">“But where wealth and value are
perhaps the most nearly connected, is in the <em>necessity of
the latter to the production of the former</em> (loc. cit.,
p. 301).</p>
<p>This is aimed especially against Ricardo: Chapter XX,
“<em>Value and Riches, Their Distinctive
Properties” [On the Principles of Political Economy,
and Taxation</em>, third ed., London, 1821, p. 320]. 
There Ricardo says, among other things:</p>
<p class="quote">“Value, then, essentially differs
from riches, for value depends not on abundance, but on the
difficulty or facility of production.”</p>
<p>&lt;Value, incidentally, can also increase with
“the facility of production”.  Let us
suppose that the number of men in a country rises from one
million to six million.  The million men worked 12
hours.  The six million have so developed the
productive powers that each of them produces as much again
in 6 hours.  In these circumstances, according to
Ricardo’s own views, wealth would have been increased
sixfold and value threefold.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“ … riches do not depend on
value.  A man is rich or poor, according to the
abundance of necessaries and luxuries which he can
command…  It is through confounding the ideas of
value and wealth, or riches that it has been asserted, that
by diminishing the quantity of commodities, that is to say
of the necessaries, conveniences, and enjoyments of human
life, riches may be increased.  If value were the
measure of riches, this could not be denied, because by
scarcity the value of commodities is raised; but … if
riches consist in necessaries and enjoyments, then they
cannot be increased by a diminution of quantity”
(op. cit., pp. 323-24).</p>
<p>In other words, Ricardo says here: wealth consists of
<em>use-values</em> only.  He transforms bourgeois
production into mere production of use-value, a very pretty
view of a mode of production which is dominated by
<em>exchange-value</em>.  He regards the specific form of
bourgeois wealth as something merely formal which does not
affect its content.  He therefore also denies the
contradictions of bourgeois production which break out in
crises.


<p><!-- TSV 3, p. 55 -->
Hence his quite false conception of money.  Hence,
in considering the production process of capital, he ignores
completely the circulation process, insofar as it includes
the metamorphosis of commodities, the necessity of the
transformation of capital into money.  At any rate
nobody has better and more precisely than Ricardo elaborated
the point that bourgeois production is not production of
wealth for the <em>producers</em> (as he repeatedly calls the
workers) and that therefore the production of bourgeois
wealth is something quite different from the production of
“abundance”, of “necessaries and
luxuries” for the men who produce them, as this would
have to be the case if production were only a means for
satisfying the needs of the producers through production
dominated by use-value alone.  Nevertheless, the same
Ricardo says:</p>
<p class="quote">“If we lived in one of Mr. Owen’s
parallelograms, and enjoyed all our productions in common,
then no one could suffer in consequence of abundance, but
<em>as long as society is constituted as it now is</em>,
abundance will often be injurious to producers, and scarcity
beneficial to them” ([Ricardo], <em>On Protection to
Agriculture</em>, fourth ed., London, 1822, p.21).</p>
<p><span class="context">||775|</span> Ricardo regards
bourgeois, or more precisely, capitalist production as the
<em>absolute form</em> of production, whose specific forms of
production relations can therefore never enter into
contradiction with, or enfetter, the aim of
production—abundance—which includes both mass
and variety of use-values, and which in turn implies a
profuse development of man as producer, an all-round
development of his productive capacities.  And this is
where he lands in an amusing contradiction: when we are
speaking of value and riches, we should have only society as
a whole in mind.  But when we speak of capital and
labour, then it is self-evident that “gross
revenue” only exists in order to create “net
revenue”.  In actual fact, what he admires most
about bourgeois production is that its definite forms—
compared with previous forms of production—provide
scope for the boundless development of the productive
forces.  When they cease to do this, or when
contradictions appear within which they do this, he denies
the contradictions, or rather, expresses the contradiction
in another form by representing <em>wealth as</em>
such—the mass of use-values in itself—without
regard to the producers, as the <em>ultima Thule</em>.</p>
<p><em>Sismondi</em> is profoundly conscious of the
contradictions in capitalist production; he is aware that,
on the one hand, its forms—its production
relations—stimulate unrestrained development
<!-- TSV 3, p. 56 -->
of the productive forces and of wealth; and that,
on the other hand, these relations are conditional, that
their contradictions of use-value and exchange-value,
commodity and money, purchase and sale, production and
consumption, capital and wage-labour, etc., assume ever
greater dimensions as productive power develops.  He is
particularly aware of the fundamental contradiction: on the
one hand, unrestricted development of the productive forces
and increase of wealth which, at the same time, consists of
commodities and must be turned into cash; on the other hand,
the system is based on the fact that the mass of producers
is restricted to the necessaries.  Hence, according to
Sismondi, crises are not accidental, as Ricardo maintains,
but essential outbreaks—occurring on a large scale and
at definite periods—of the immanent
contradictions.  He wavers constantly: should the State
curb the productive forces to make them adequate to the
production relations, or should the production relations be
made adequate to the productive forces?  He often
retreats into the past, becomes a <em>laudator temporis
acti,<a href="#-ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[gg]</a></em> or he
seeks to exorcise the contradictions by a different
adjustment of revenue in relation to capital, or of
distribution in relation to production, not realising that
the relations of distribution are only the relations of
production seen from a different aspect.  He forcefully
<em>criticises</em> the contradictions of bourgeois production
but does not <em>understand</em> them, and consequently does
not understand the process whereby they can be
resolved.  However, at the bottom of his argument is
indeed the inkling that <em>new</em> forms of the
appropriation of wealth must correspond to productive forces
and the material and social conditions for the production of
wealth which have developed within capitalist society; that
the bourgeois forms are only transitory and contradictory
forms, in which wealth attains only an antithetical
existence and appears everywhere simultaneously as its
opposite.  It is wealth which always has poverty as its
prerequisite and only develops by developing poverty as
well.</p>
<p>We have now seen how nicely Malthus appropriates
Sismondi.  Malthus’s theory is expressed in an
exaggerated and even more nauseating form in <em>On Political
Economy in connexion with the Moral State and Moral
Prospects of Society</em>, second ed., London, 1832, by
<em>Thomas Chalmers (Professor of Divinity</em>).  Here
the parsonic element is more in evidence not only
theoretically
<!-- TSV 3, p. 57 -->
but also practically, since this member of the
Established Church defends it “economically”
with its “loaves and fishes” and the whole
complex of institutions with which this Church stands or
falls.</p>
<p>The passages in Malthus (referred to above) having
reference to the workers are the following:</p>
<p class="quote">“… the consumption and demand
occasioned by the workmen employed in productive labour can
never <em>alone</em> furnish a motive to the accumulation and
employment of capital” (<em>Principles of Political
Economy</em>, [London, 1836,] p. 315).</p>
<p class="quote">“No farmer will take the trouble of
superintending the labour of ten additional men merely
because his whole produce will then sell in the market at an
advanced price just equal to what he had paid his additional
labourers.  There must be something in the previous
state of the demand and supply of the commodity in question,
or in its price, antecedent to and independent of the demand
occasioned by the new labourers, in order to warrant the
employment of an additional number of people in its
production” (op. cit., p. 312).</p>
<p class="quote">“The demand created by the productive
labourer himself can never be an <em>adequate</em> demand,
<span class="context">||776|</span> because it does not go
to the <em>full extent of what he produces.  If it did,
there would be no profit</em>, consequently no motive to
employ him.  The very <em>existence of a profit upon any
commodity</em> presupposes a demand <em>exterior</em> to that
of the labour which has produced it” (op. cit.,
p. 405, note).</p>
<p class="quote">“… as a great increase of
consumption among the working classes must greatly increase
the cost of production, it must lower profits, and diminish
or destroy the motive to accumulate…”
(loc. cit., p. 405).</p>
<p class="quote">“It is the <em>want of necessaries</em>
which mainly stimulates the labouring<a href="#-ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[hh]</a> classes to produce luxuries; and
were this stimulus removed or greatly weakened, so that the
necessaries of life could be obtained with very little
labour, instead of more time being devoted to the production
of conveniences, there is every reason to think that less
time would be so devoted” (op cit., p.334).</p>
<p>Malthus is interested not in concealing the
contradictions of bourgeois production, but on the contrary,
in emphasising them, on the one hand, in order to prove that
the poverty of the working classes is necessary (as it is,
indeed, for this mode of production) and, on the other hand,
to demonstrate to the capitalists the necessity for a
well-fed Church and State hierarchy in order to create an
adequate demand for the commodities they produce.  He
thus shows that for “… continued increase<a href="#-ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[ii]</a> of wealth”
[op. cit., p. 314] neither increase of population nor
accumulation of capital suffices (op. cit., pp. 319-20), nor
“fertility of the soil”
<!-- TSV 3, p. 58 -->
(op. cit., p. 331), nor “labour-saving
inventions”, nor the extension of the “foreign
markets” (op. cit., pp. 352 and 359).</p>
<p class="quote">“…both labourers and capital
may be redundant, compared with the means of employing them
profitably” (op. cit., p. 414 [note]).</p>
<p>Thus he emphasises the possibility of general
over-production in opposition to the view of the Ricardians
(inter alia op. cit., p. 326).</p>
<p>The principal propositions dealing with this matter are
the following:</p>
<p class="quote">“… demand is always determined
by <em>value</em>, and supply by <em>quantity</em>”
(op. cit., p. 316, note).</p>
<p>Commodities are exchanged not only for commodities but
also for productive labour and personal services and in
relation to them, and also to money, there can be a general
glut of commodities<a href="#-ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[jj]</a> (loc. cit.).</p>
<p class="quote">“… supply must always be
proportioned to <em>quantity</em>, and demand to
<em>value” (Definitions in Political Economy</em>,
ed. by John Cazenove, London, 4853, p. 65 [note]).</p>
<p class="quote">“‘It is evident,’ says
James Mill ‘that whatever a man has produced, and does
not wish to keep for his own consumption, is a stock which
he may give in exchange for other commodities.  His
will, therefore, to purchase, and his means of purchasing,
in other words, his demand, is […] equal to the
amount of what he has produced, and does not mean to
consume.’…      It is quite obvious”
[answers Malthus] “that his means of purchasing other
commodities are not proportioned to the <em>quantity</em> of
his own commodity which he has produced, and wishes to part
with; but to its <em>value in exchange;</em> and unless the
value of a commodity in exchange be proportioned to its
quantity, it cannot be true that the demand and supply of
every individual are always equal to one another”
(loc. cit., pp. 64-65).</p>
<p class="quote">“If the demand of every individual
were equal to his supply, in the correct sense of the
expression, it would be a proof that he could always sell
his commodity for the costs of production, including fair
profits; and then even a <em>partial</em> glut would be
impossible.  The argument proves too much …
supply must always be proportioned to <em>quantity</em>, and
demand to <em>value</em> “(<em>Definitions in Political
Economy</em>, London, 1827, p. 48, note).</p>
<p>Here, by demand Mill understands the “means of
purchasing” of the person who demands.  But
“… his<a href="#-ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[kk]</a> means of purchasing other
commodities are not proportioned to the <em>quantity</em> of
his own commodity which he has produced, and wishes to part
with; but to its <em>value in exchange;</em> and unless the
value of a commodity in exchange be proportioned to its
quantity, it cannot be true that the demand and supply of
every individual are always equal to one another”
(loc. cit., pp. 48-49).</p>
<p class="quote">“It is still further from the
truth”<a href="#-ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[ll]</a> for
Torrens to say “‘that increased supply is the
one and only cause of increased effectual demand’
[…].  If
<!-- TSV 3, p. 59 -->
it were, how difficult would it be for a society<a href="#-ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[mm]</a> to recover itself,
under a temporary diminution of food and clothing, But
[…]<a href="#-ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[nn]</a> food
and clothing […] diminished in quantity will rise in
value […] the money-price of the remaining food and
clothing will for a time rise in a greater degree than [in
proportion to] the diminution of its quantity, while the
money-price of labour may remain the same.  The
necessary consequence […] the power of setting in
motion a greater quantity of productive industry than
before” (op. cit., pp. 59-60).</p>
<p>All a nation’s commodities may fall compared with money
or labour (op.  cit., p.64 et seq.).  Thus a general
glut of the market is possible (loc. cit.).  Their
prices can all fall below their production costs
(loc. cit.).<a href="#-ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[oo]</a></p>
<p>*  *  *</p>
<p><span class="context">||777|</span> For the rest, only
the following passage from Malthus, which deals with the
circulation process, need be noted.</p>
<p class="quote">“… if we reckon the value of
the fixed capital employed as a part of the advances, we
must reckon the remaining value of such capital at the end
of the year as a part of the annual returns … in
reality his” (the capitalist’s) “<em>annual
advances consist only</em> of his circulating capital, the
wear and tear of his fixed capital with the interest upon
it, and the interest of that part of his circulating capital
which consists of the money employed in making his annual
payments as they are called for” (<em>Principles of
Political Economy</em>, [second ed., London, 1836,] p. 
269).</p>
<p>The <em>sinking fund</em>, i.e., the fund for wear and tear
of the fixed capital, is, in my opinion, at the same time a
fund for accumulation.</p>
<h3>[13.  Critique of Malthus’s Conception of
“Unproductive Consumers” by Supporters of
Ricardo]</h3>
<p>I wish to quote yet a few passages from a Ricardian book
directed against Malthus’s theory.  As regards the
attacks from the capitalist point of view which are made in
the book against Malthus’s unproductive consumers in general
and landlords in particular I shall demonstrate elsewhere
that they can be used word for word against the capitalists
from the workers’ standpoint.  (This is to be included
in the section “The Relationship Between Capital and
Wage-Labour Presented from an Apologetic
Standpoint”.)</p>
<p>[An anonymous follower of Ricardo writes:]</p>
<!-- TSV 3, p. 60 -->
<p class="quote">“Considering, that an increased
employment of capital will not take place unless a rate of
profits equal to the former rate, or greater than it, can be
ensured, and considering, that the mere addition to capital
does not of itself tend to ensure such a rate of profits,
but the reverse, Mr. Malthus, and those who reason in the
same manner as he does, proceed to look out for some source,
independent of and extrinsic to production itself, whose
progressive increase may keep pace with the progressive
increase of capital, and from which continual additional
supplies of the requisite rate of profits may be
derived” (<em>An Inquiry into those Principles,
respecting the Nature of Demand and the Necessity of
Consumption, lately advocated by Mr. Malthus etc</em>.,
London, 1821, pp. 33-34).</p>
<p>According to Malthus, the “unproductive
consumers” are such a source (loc. cit., p. 35).</p>
<p class="quote">“Mr. Malthus sometimes talks as if
there were two <em>distinct funds</em>, capital and revenue,
supply and demand, production and consumption, which must
take care to keep pace with each other, and neither outrun
the other.  As if, <em>besides the whole mass of
commodities produced</em>, there was required another mass,
fallen from Heaven, I suppose, to purchase them
with…  The fund for consumption, such as he
requires, can only be had at the expense of
production” (op. cit., pp. 49-50).</p>
<p class="quote">“We are continually puzzled, in
his” (Malthus’s) “speculations, between the
object of increasing production and that of checking
it.  When a man is in want of a <em>demand</em>, does
Mr. Malthus recommend him to pay some other person to take
off his goods?  Probably not” (op. cit.,
p. 55).  Certainly yes.</p>
<p class="quote">“The object of selling your goods is
to make a certain amount of money; it never can answer to
part with that amount of money for nothing, to another
person, that he may bring it back to you, and buy your goods
with it: you might as well have just burnt your goods at
once, and you would have been in the same situation”
(op. cit., p. 63).</p>
<p>[He is] right in regard to Malthus.  But because it
is one and the same fund—”the whole mass of
commodities produced”— which constitutes the
production fund and the consumption fund, the fund of supply
and the fund of demand, the fund of capital and the fund of
revenue, it does not by any means follow that it is
irrelevant how the total fund is divided between these
various categories.</p>
<p>The anonymous author does not understand what Malthus
means when he speaks of the “demand” of the
workers being “inadequate” for the
capitalist.</p>
<p class="quote">“… as to the <em>demand</em>
from labour; that is, either the giving labour in exchange
for goods, or … in exchange<a href="#-ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[pp]</a> for present complete products, a
future and accruing addition of value…  This is
the real demand that it is material to the producers to get
increased” (op.  cit., p. 57).</p>
<p>What Malthus means is not the <em>offer of labour</em>
(which our author calls <em>demand from labour</em>) but the
demand for commodities
<!-- TSV 3, p. 61 -->
which the wages the worker receives enable him to make,
the money with which the worker buys commodities on the
market.  And Malthus rightly says of this demand that
it can never be adequate to the supply of the
capitalist.  Otherwise the worker would be able to buy
back the whole of his product with his wages.</p>
<p><span class="context">||778|</span> The same writer
says:</p>
<p class="quote">“… the very meaning of an
increased demand by them” (the labourers) “is a
disposition to take less themselves, and leave a larger
share for their employers; and if it be said<a href="#-ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[qq]</a> that this, by
diminishing consumption, increases glut, I can only answer,
that glut […] is synonymous with high profits”
(op. cit., p. 59).</p>
<p>This is meant to be witty, but in fact it contains the
essential secret of “glut”.</p>
<p>In connection with Malthus’s <em>Essay on Rent</em>, our
author says:</p>
<p class="quote">“When Mr. Malthus published his
<em>Essay on Rent</em>, it seems to have been partly with a
view to answer the cry of ‘No Landlords’, which
then ‘stood rubric on the walls’, to stand up in
defence of that class, and to prove that they were not like
<em>monopolists</em>.  That rent cannot be abolished,
that its increase is a natural concomitant, in general, of
increasing wealth and numbers, he shewed; but neither did
the vulgar cry of ‘No Landlords’ necessarily
mean that there ought to be <em>no such thing</em> as rent,
but rather that it ought to be equally divided among the
people, according to what was called ‘Spence’s
plan’.  But when he proceeds to vindicate
landlords from the odious name of monopolists, from the
observation of Smith, ‘that they love to reap where
they never sowed’, he seems to be fighting for a
<em>name</em>…  There is too much the air of an
<em>advocate</em> in all these arguments of his”
(op. cit., pp. 108-09)</p>
<h3>[14.  The Reactionary Role of Malthus’s Writings
and Their Plagiaristic Character.  Malthus’s Apologia
for the Existence of “Upper” and
“Lower” Classes]</h3>
<p><em>Malthus</em>’s book <em>On Population</em> was a lampoon
directed against the French Revolution and the contemporary
ideas of reform in England (Godwin, etc.).  It was an
apologia for the poverty of the working classes.  The
<em>theory</em> was plagiarised from Townsend and others.</p>
<p>His <em>Essay on Rent</em> was a piece of polemic writing
in support of the landlords against industrial
capital.  Its <em>theory</em> was taken from
Anderson.</p>
<p>His <em>Principles of Political Economy</em> was a polemic
work written in the interests of the capitalists against the
workers and in
<!-- TSV 3, p. 62 -->
the interests of the aristocracy, Church, tax-eaters,
toadies, etc., against the capitalists.  Its
<em>theory</em> was taken from Adam Smith.  Where he
inserts his own inventions, it is pitiable.  It is on
Sismondi that he bases himself in further elaborating the
theory.  <span class="context">|XIV-778||</span></p>
<p>*  *  *</p>
<p><span class="context">||VIII-345|</span> <em>{Malthus</em>
makes the following remarks, laced with his usual
“profound philosophy’, against any plan to
provide the cottagers of England with cows (in the French
translation of his <em>An Essay on the Principles of
Population</em>, fifth ed., translated by P. Prévost, Genève,
1836, troisième éd., t. IV, pp. 104-05):</p>
<p class="quote">“it has been observed that those
<em>cottagers</em>, who keep cows, are more industrious and
more regular in their conduct, than those who do
not…  Most of those who keep cows at present
have purchased them with the fruits of their own
industry.  It is therefore more just to say that their
industry has given them a cow, than that a cow has given
them their industry” [Malthus, <em>An Essay on the
Principles of Population</em>, fifth ed., Vol. 2, London,
1817, pp.  296-97].</p>
<p>And it is therefore correct that diligence in labour
(together with the exploitation of other people’s labour)
has given cows to the parvenus amongst the bourgeoisie,
while the cows give their sons the taste for idleness. 
If one took away from their cows not the ability to give
milk, but to command other people’s unpaid labour, it would
be a very good thing for their taste for labour.</p>
<p>The selfsame “profound philosopher”
remarks:</p>
<p class="quote">“<em>But it is evident that all cannot
be in the middle</em>.  Superior and inferior parts are
in the nature of things absolutely necessary; and […]
“ (naturally there can be no mean without extremes)
“strikingly beneficial.  If no man could hope to
rise, or fear to fall in society; if industry did not bring
with it its reward, and indolence its punishment; we could
not expect to see that animated activity in bettering our
condition, which now forms the master-spring <span class="context">||346|</span> of public prosperity”
([Malthus, <em>Principles of Population</em>, p. 303,]
Prévost, p. 112).</p>
<p>Thus there must be lower classes in order that the upper
ones may fear to fall and there must be upper classes in
order that the lower ones may hope to rise.  In order
that indolence may carry its own punishments the worker must
be poor and the rentier and the landlord, so beloved of
Malthus, must be rich.  But what does Malthus mean by
the reward of industry?  As we shall see later, he
means that the worker must perform part of his labour
without an equivalent return.  A wonderful stimulus,
provided the “reward”
<!-- TSV 3, p. 63 -->
and not hunger were the stimulus.   What
it all boils down to is that a worker may hope to exploit
other workers some day.</p>
<p>Rousseau says: “The more monopoly spreads, the
heavier do the chains become for the exploited.”</p>
<p>Malthus, “the profound thinker”, has
different views.  His supreme hope, which he himself
describes as more or less utopian, is that the mass of the
middle class should grow and that the proletariat (those who
work) should constitute a constantly declining proportion
(even though it increases absolutely) of the total
population.  This in fact is the <em>course</em> taken by
bourgeois society.</p>
<p class="quote">“We might even venture,” says
Malthus, “to indulge a hope that at some future period
the processes for abridging human labour, the progress of
which has of late years been so rapid, might ultimately
supply all the wants of the most wealthy society with less
personal effort than at present; and <em>if they did not
diminish the severity of individual exertion</em>” (he
must go on risking just as much as before, and relatively
more and more for others and less and less for himself),
“might, at least, diminish the <em>number of those</em>
employed in severe toil” ([Malthus, <em>Principles of
Population</em>, p. 304,] Prévost, p. 113).} <span class="context">|VIII-346||</span></p>
<h3>[15.  Malthus’s Principles Expounded in the
Anonymous “Outlines of Political Economy”]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||XIV-778|</span> A book in which
Malthus’s principles are elaborated is <em>Outlines of
Political Economy; being a Plain and Short View of the Laws
relating to the Production, Distribution, and Consumption of
Wealth etc</em>., London, 1832.</p>
<p>First of all the author<a href="#-ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[rr]</a> explains the practical reasons
governing the opposition of the Malthusians to the
determination of value by labour-time.</p>
<p class="quote">“That labour is the sole source of
wealth seems to be a doctrine as dangerous as it is false,
as it unhappily affords a handle to those who would
represent all property as belonging to the working classes,
and the share which is received by others as a robbery or
fraud upon them” ([John Cazenove, <em>Outlines of
Political Economy</em>, London, 1832, ] p. 22, note).</p>
<p>In the following sentence it emerges more clearly than in
Malthus that the author confuses the <em>value</em> of
commodities with the <em>utilisation</em> of commodities, or
of money as capital.  In the latter sense it correctly
expresses the origin of surplus-value.</p>
<!-- TSV 3, p. 64 -->
<p class="quote">“The <em>value of capital</em>, the
quantity of labour which it is worth or will command, is
[…] always greater than that which it has cost, and
the difference constitutes the profit or remuneration to its
owner” (op. cit., p. 32).</p>
<p>The following, too, which is taken from Malthus, is
correct as an explanation of why profit is to be reckoned as
part of the <em>production costs</em> of capitalist
production:</p>
<p class="quote">“… profit upon the capital
employed” &lt; “unless this profit were
obtained, there would be no adequate motive to produce the
commodity”&gt; “is an essential condition of the
supply, and, as such, constitutes a component part of the
<em>costs of production</em>” (loc. cit., p. 33).</p>
<p>In the following passage we have, on the one hand, the
correct statement that profit directly arises out of the
exchange of capital for labour, and on the other hand, the
Malthusian thesis that profit is made in <em>selling</em>.</p>
<p class="quote">“… a man’s profit does not
depend upon his command of the <em>produce</em> of other men’s
labour, but upon his command of <em>Labour itself</em>.”
(Here the correct distinction is made between the exchange
of one commodity for another and the exchange of the
commodity as capital for labour.) “If”(when the
<em>value of money</em> falls) “he <span class="context">||779|</span> can sell his goods at a higher
price, <em>while his workmen’s wages remain unaltered</em>, he
is clearly benefited by the rise, whether other goods rise
or not.  A smaller proportion of what he produces is
sufficient to put that labour into motion, and a larger
proportion consequently remains for himself “ (op.
cit, , pp. 49-50).</p>
<p>The same thing happens when, for example, as a result of
the introduction of new machinery, chemical processes, etc.,
the capitalist produces commodities below their old value
and, either sells them at their old value or, at any rate,
above the individual value to which they have fallen. 
It is true that when this happens, the worker does not
directly work a shorter period for himself and a longer one
for the capitalist, but in the reproduction process,
“a smaller proportion of what he produces is
sufficient to put that labour into motion”.  In
actual fact, the worker therefore exchanges a greater part
of his immediate labour than previously for his own realised
labour.  For example, he continues to receive what he
received previously, £10.  But this £10, although it
represents the same amount of labour to society, is no
longer the product of the <em>same amount of labour-time</em>
as previously, but may represent one hour less.  So
that, in fact, the worker works longer for the capitalist
and a shorter period for himself.  It is as if he
received only £8, which, however, represented the same mass
of use-values as a result of the increased productivity of
his labour.


<p><!-- TSV 3, p. 65 -->
The author remarks in connection with [James] Mill’s s
arguments regarding the identity of demand and supply,
discussed earlier:</p>
<p class="quote">“The supply of each man depends upon
the <em>quantity</em> which he brings to market: his demand
for other things depends upon the <em>value</em> of his
supply.  The former is certain; it depends upon
himself: the latter is uncertain; it depends upon
others.  The former may remain the same, whilst the
latter may vary.  A hundred quarters of corn, which a
man brings to market, may at one time be worth thirty
shillings, and at another time sixty shillings, the
quarter.  The <em>quantity or supply</em> is in both
instances the same; but the man’s demand or power of
purchasing other things is twice as great in the latter as
in the former case” (op. cit., pp. 111-12).</p>
<p>About the relationship of labour and machinery, the
author writes the following:</p>
<p class="quote">“… when commodities are
multiplied by a more judicious distribution of labour, no
greater amount of demand than before is required in order to
maintain all the labour which was previously
employed;”</p>
<p>(How so?  If the distribution of labour is more
judicious, more commodities will be produced by the same
labour; hence the supply will grow, and does its absorption
not require an increased amount of demand?  Does Adam
Smith not rightly say that division of labour depends upon
the extent of the market?  In actual fact, the
difference as regards demand from outside is the same except
[that demand] on a larger scale [is required] when machinery
is used.  But “a more judicious distribution of
labour” may require the same or even a greater number
of labourers than before, while the introduction of
machinery must under all circumstances diminish the
proportion of capital laid out in immediate labour)</p>
<p class="quote">“whereas, when machinery is
introduced, if there be not an increased amount of demand,
or a fall in wages or profits, <em>some of the labour will
undoubtedly be thrown out of employment</em> […] let
the case be supposed of a commodity worth £1,200, of which
£1,000 consists of the wages of 100 men, at £10 each, and
£200 of profits, at the rate of 20 per cent.  Now, let
it be imagined that the same commodity can be produced by
the labour of 50 men, and a machine which has cost the
labour of 50 men, and which requires the labour of 10 men to
keep it in constant repair; the producer will then be able
to reduce the price of the article to £800, and still
continue to obtain the same remuneration for the use of his
capital […]</p>

&lt;(The “10 men to keep it in […]
repair” represent here the annual wear and tear. 
Otherwise the calculation would be wrong, since the labour
of repairing would then have to be added to the original
production costs of the machinery.)  Previously the
manufacturer had to lay out £1,000 annually, but the product
was [worth] £1,200.  Now he has laid out £500 on
machinery once and for all; he has not therefore to lay out
this sum again in any other way.  What he has to lay
out is £100 annually for repairs and £500 in wages (since
there are no raw materials in this example).  He has to
lay out only £600 per annum, but he makes a profit of £200
on his total capital just as he did previously.  The
amount and rate of profit remain the same as they were
before.  But his annual product amounts to only
£800.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“Those who used to pay £1,200 for the
commodity will now have £400 to spare, which they can lay
out either on something else, or in purchasing more of the
same commodity.  If it be laid out in <span class="context">||780|</span> the <em>produce</em> of
immediate labour, it will give employment to no more than
33.4 men, whereas the number thrown out of employment by the
introduction of the machine will have been 40,
for—</p>
<p>The wages of 33.4 men at £10, are
£334</p>
<p><em>Profits</em> 20 per cent £66</p>
<p>Total £400”</p>
<p>(loc. cit., pp. 114-16).</p>
<p>&lt;In other words this means: If the £400 is expended on
commodities which are the product of immediate labour and if
the wages per man equal £10, then the commodities which cost
£400 must be the product of less than 40 men.  If they
were the product of 40 men, then they would contain only
<em>paid labour</em>.  The value of labour (or the
quantity of labour embodied in the wages) would be equal to
the value of the product (the quantity of labour embodied in
the commodity).  But the commodities worth £400 contain
<em>unpaid</em> labour, which is precisely what constitutes
the profit.  They must therefore be the product of less
than 40 men.  If the profit is 20 per cent, then only
<sup class="ratio">5</sup>/<sub class="ratio">6</sub> of the product can consist of paid
labour, that is, approximately £334 or 33.4 men at £10 per
man.  The other sixth, roughly £66, represents the
unpaid labour.  Ricardo himself has shown in exactly
the same way that machinery itself, when its money price is
as high as the price of the immediate labour it displaces,
can never be the product of so much labour.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“If it” (i.e., the £400)
“be laid out in the purchase of more of the same
commodity, or of any other, where the same species and
quantity of fixed capital were used, it would employ only 30
men, for—


<p><!-- TSV 3, p. 67 -->
The wages of 25 men at £10 each, are
£250</p>
<p>[The wages of] 5 men [at £10 each] to keep [it] in
repair £50</p>
<p>Profits on £250 circulated and £250 fixed capital £100</p>
<p>£400”</p>
<p>(loc. cit., p.  116).</p>
<p>&lt;That is to say, in the case where machinery is
introduced, the production of commodities costing £800
involves an outlay of £500 on machinery.  Thus for the
production of £400 [worth of commodities] only £250 [is
spent on machinery].  Furthermore, 50 workers are
needed to operate machinery worth £500, therefore 25 workers
([their wages] amounting to £250) for machinery worth £250;
further for repair (the maintenance of the machine) 10 men
are needed if the machinery costs £500, consequently 5 men (
[whose wages] come to £50) are needed for machinery costing
£250.  Thus [we have] £250 fixed capital and £250
circulating capital—a total of £500, on which there is
a profit of 20 per cent amounting to £100.  The product
is therefore [made up of] £300 wages and £100
profit—£400.  Thirty workers are employed in
producing the commodities.  Here it has been assumed
all along that the capitalist who manufactures the
commodities either borrows capital out of the (£400) savings
which the consumers have deposited at the bank, or
that—apart from the £400 which have been saved from
the revenue of the consumers— he himself possesses
capital.  For clearly with a capital of £400 he cannot
lay out £250 on machinery and £300 on wages.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“When the total sum of £1,200 was
spent on the produce of immediate labour, the division was
£1,000 wages, £200 profits” (100 workers whose wages
come to £1,000).  “When it was spent partly in
the one way and partly in the other … the division
was £934 wages and £266 profits” (i.e., 60 workers in
the machine shop and 33.4 immediate labour making a total of
93.4 workers, whose wages come to £934), “and, as in
the third supposition, when the whole sum was spent on the
joint produce of the machine and labour, the division was
£900 wages” (i.e., 90 workers) “and £300
profits” (loc. cit., pp. 114-17 [passim]).</p>
<p><span class="context">||781|</span> After the
introduction [of the machine] the capitalist
“certainly cannot employ as much labour as he did
before, without accumulating further capital; but […]
the revenue which is saved by the consumers of the article
after its price has fallen, will, by increasing their
consumption of that or something else, create a demand for
<em>some</em> though not for <em>all</em> the labour which has
been displaced by the machine” (op. cit., p. 119
[note]).</p>
<p class="quote">“Mr. McCulloch […] conceives
that the introduction of machines into any employment
<em>necessarily occasions on equal or greater demand for the
disengaged labourers in some other employment</em>,
[…] In order to prove this, he supposes that the
annuity necessary to replace the value of the machine
<!-- TSV 3, p. 68 -->
by the time it is worn out, will every year occasion an
increasing demand for labour.  But as the successive
annuities added together up to the end of the term, can only
equal the original cost of the machine, and the interest
upon it during the time it is in operation, in what way it
can ever create a demand for labour, beyond what it would
have done had no machine been employed, it is not easy to
understand” (loc. cit., pp. 119-20 [note]).</p>
<p>The sinking fund itself can, indeed, be used for
accumulation in the interval when the wear and tear of the
machine is shown in the books, but does not actually affect
its work.  But in any case, the demand for labour
created in this way is much smaller than if the whole
capital invested in machinery were laid out in wages,
instead of merely the annual wear and tear.  MacPeter
is an ass—as always.  This passage is only
noteworthy, because it contains the idea that the sinking
fund is itself a fund for accumulation.</p>
