<h4>London, 15 January 1866<br>
1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</h4>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>A happy New Year and best thanks for your kind letter.</p>
<p>You must excuse the brevity of these lines on account of my being excessively busy at present. I'll write more fully next time. I am enclosing two cards and will let you know in my next letter which questions are to be dealt with at the public congress in Geneva at the end of May.</p>
<p>Our Association has made great progress. It already has 3 official organs, one in London, <em>The Workman’s Advocate, </em>one in Brussels, <em>La Tribune du Peuple, </em>one put out by the French section in Switzerland, <em>Journal de 1'Association Internationale des Travailleurs, Section de la Suisse Romande</em> (Geneva), and in a few days time a journal is to be put out by the German-Swiss section, <em>Der Vorbote,</em> under the editorship of <em>J. P. Becker. </em>(Address: 6 rue du Môle, Genf, J. P. Becker, in case you wanted to send him an occasional article, political or social).</p>
<p>We have succeeded in attracting into the movement the only really big workers’ organisation, the English ‘<strong>trade unions’,</strong><em> </em>which previously concerned themselves <em>exclusively</em> with the wage question. With their help, the English society we founded to achieve <strong>universal suffrage</strong> (half of its Central Committee consists of members — working men — of our Central Committee) held a giant <strong>meeting</strong> a few weeks ago, at which only working men spoke. You can tell what effect it had from the fact that the <strong>leaders </strong>of two successive issues of <em>The Times </em>were concerned with this <strong>meeting</strong>. </p>
<p>As regards my work, <span class="context">[Capital]</span> I am now busy 12 hours a day writing out the fair copy. I am thinking of taking the manuscript of the first volume to Hamburg myself in March and using the opportunity to see you.</p>
<p>I was much amused by the antics of Justus von Möser’s successor. How wretched a man of talent must be who seeks and finds satisfaction in trivialities of that kind! </p>
<p>As regards Bürgers, he is doubtless well-meaning, but weak. It is not much over a year ago that he declared at a public <strong>meeting</strong> in Cologne (it appeared in print in the Cologne papers) that Schulze-Delitzsch had ‘solved’ the social question once and for all and that only <em>personal friendship for me </em>had induced him (Bürgers) to stray onto the tangled paths of communism! After such public <em>statements, </em>could I regard him as other than a ‘renegade’?</p>
<p class="sig">Your most sincere friend<br>
K. Marx</p>
