<h4>[London,] 15 January 1866</h4>
<p>Dear <strong>Library</strong>,</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>You must excuse my silence, ditto the brevity of these lines of mine. You will not believe <strong>how bothered</strong> I am for time. <em>Indisposition</em>, forever recurring periodically, all manner of unfortunate <em>mischances demands made on me</em> by the <strong>International Association</strong>, etc., have confiscated every free moment I have for writing out the fair copy of my manuscript. <span class="context">[<em>Capital</em>]</span> I hope to be able to take Volume I of it to the publisher for printing myself in March. (The whole thing, the two volumes, will, however, appear <em>simultaneously </em>This<em> is good</em>.)</p>
<p>So, this very much by way of summary.</p>
<p>Today I am sending you by post the 2 latest issues of <em>The Workman’s Advocate, </em>of which Eccarius is now editor. If, as I hope, you send any <em>articles </em>for it, please do so to me (political, social, as you will).</p>
<p>I also enclose <strong>cards of membership</strong><em> </em>for you. I have paid for them. You can therefore give them to whomever you like, and have only to inscribe the name and after the £, put 0, but after the Os., 1d.</p>
<p>The conditions, <strong>generally</strong>, are these: <em>a society as such </em>that wishes to join has an <em>Association collective membership Card</em>, for which 5s. per year is to be paid. But, if all the members join individually, they have to take out cards of the kind I am sending you. This is advantageous for workers. The cards serve as a passport abroad, and their <em>confréres</em> in London, Paris, Brussels, Lyons, Geneva, etc., will get jobs for them.</p>
<p>The Association has made great progress. It already has 1 official English paper, <em>The Workman’s Advocate, </em>a Brussels one, <em>La Tribune du Peuple, </em>a French one in Geneva, <em>Journal de 1'Association Internationale des Travailleurs, Section de la Suisse Romande</em>, and a German one in Geneva, <em>Der Vorbote, </em>which will be appearing in a few days. <em>Address: 6 rue du Môle, Genf, J. P. Becker, </em>in case you want to write to the old man occasionally (as I hope you will).</p>
<p>I am now hoping you will soon make it possible for me to announce the foundation of a Leipzig section and enable me to present correspondence. (<em>In English. </em>It can then be used in <em>The Workman’s Advocate </em>as well.) The number is not important, although <strong>the more, the better</strong>.</p>
<p>If people want to join <em>en masse, </em>as a society, you will see that the <em>total price </em>of 5s., which they have to pay annually, is <em>nothing</em>. </p>
<p>J. P. Becker writes to me:</p>
<p class="quoteb">‘Sections are going to be formed in Leipzig, Gotha, Stuttgart and Nuremberg; shall we register them here for the time being, until there is a large number and a Central Committee has been formed in Germany?’</p>
<p>I have replied <em>in the affirmative</em>. However, since there can be several branches in one town, you and your people can establish links direct with us.</p>
<p>I have had a second letter from the Berliners. I am at last writing to them today. Ditto to Dr Kugelmann.</p>
<p><em>Salut</em>.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>I will let you know next time what questions are to be dealt with at the Geneva Congress at the end of May.</p>
