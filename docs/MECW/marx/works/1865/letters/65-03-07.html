<h4>[London,] 7 March 1865</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>My brother-in-law is leaving today to return to the Cape. I've got to accompany him onto the ship. So, I'm very short of time — hence just the following in the utmost brevity:</p>
<p>1.<em> Ad vocem Bruhn. </em>A worker in Paris received a letter from a worker in Hamburg saying that Bruhn is slandering us in every way he can. Firstly, he says I owe him 60 talers which I never repaid. Secondly, you and I are said to have sold the Prussian government, or rather ‘Police-Chief Stieber’, a manuscript about the refugees. The Parisian sent the letter to Lessner, who passed it on to me. I replied to Lessner by return of post, for communication to the Parisian, that I had <em>never </em>had any financial dealings with Bruhn (which I believed at that time to be the case), and in general considered that for Bruhn to ever have 60 talers to his name was like something out of Munchausen. Furthermore, I explained the affair of Bangya and the manuscript, in which connection our declaration of April 1853 in the <em>New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung </em><span class="context">[<em>Hirsch’s Confessions</em>]</span> and references to it in <em>Herr Vogt </em>page such and such were to be consulted. <strong>Well</strong>! Then Bruhn’s letter arrived. So, I racked my brains and think I remember the following: in the spring of 1849 I came to Hamburg to collect money for the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em>. I had just enough in <strong>my pocket</strong> to get to Hamburg. However, stayed 14 days in a <strong>first rate</strong> hotel. I explained to Baron Frisch, who later intended to send us donations, that I needed money to pay the hotel bill and my return fare. I now have a dim recollection that since I didn’t want to take the money as a ‘<strong>present’ </strong>from him and he for his part didn’t want it back, it was agreed that <em>Bruhn </em>who was just as much a scoundrel then as now, should receive it. I had forgotten the whole bloody business; however, I now wrote to Bruhn that I couldn’t remember any financial transaction with <em>him. </em>Since the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung </em>was banned when I got back to Cologne from Hamburg and I myself was kicked out of Prussia, it was possible that in the whirl of events at the time I had forgotten. It is still striking that he waited from 1849 to 1865 to <em>remind </em>me. But it was a simple matter. He should let me know by letter how much he thought he had on me and send me Grubel’s address. I would then write to Grubel myself. If the latter <em>confirmed </em>what he said, his demand would be satisfied. This procedure is absolutely essential, as I am <em>still </em>uncertain about the matter <em>even at this moment, </em>and the way I have been fleeced by claims of this kind is really scandalous.</p>
<p>2. From the <em>enclosed from Schily you will </em>see what transpired in Paris whither we sent Le Lubez to settle the disputes that had broken out there. (We had given <em>Schily </em>ditto <strong>full power</strong> to negotiate, as we were aware of Le Lubez’s bias towards Lefort. Here I should just mention in passing that <em>Beluze, </em>President of the People’s Bank, who controls the few Paris Associations and their organ <em>L'Association, </em>is<em> with </em>Lefort.) <em>What else happens — </em>which will only be concluded this evening, as far as our intervention is concerned — in the <em>next letter.</em></p>
<p>3. The things from <em>Siebel </em>returned. It strikes me as <em>most unfortunate </em>that he gives <em>London </em>as the origin of the notice put in the <em>Düsseldorfer Zeitung, </em>thus exposing <em>me </em>as the presumed author.</p>
<p>4. Letter from Liebknecht enclosed.</p>
<p>5. One copy of the circular from the Geneva <strong>Branch Association</strong> enclosed.</p>
<p>6. The letter from Meissner enclosed.</p>
<p>7.<em> Lange: </em>not to be directly rebuffed. Write and tell him that he would do best to post the thing to you, 2 <strong>copies</strong>, and you would send one to me each time. As he rightly realises himself, after our recent experience we would have to hold back <em>for the present </em>from making contributions to any German paper. He would, of course, have the same right as any other <strong>Editor</strong> of a journal to reprint whatever extracts he liked from your pamphlet.</p>
<p><em>Salut.</em></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>The first numbers (2 sheets) of Blind’s <em>Eidgenosse </em>have come, with the only contributions by Blind, Struve and Rasch. Trivia. Emblem consisting of hand with dagger, to kill the ‘tyrants’.</p>
