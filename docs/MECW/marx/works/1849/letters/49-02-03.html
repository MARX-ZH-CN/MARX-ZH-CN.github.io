<h4>Cologne, 3 February 1849</h4>
<p>Dear Dronke,</p>
<p>Your letter, passed on to me by Engels, I shall answer briefly as follows:</p>
<p>1. As regards your coming here: When I wrote ‘Don’t come to Germany until I write to you’, <em>Kratz</em> had told me that your case was not yet quite settled.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#252" target=_blank>[252]</a></sup></p>
<p>2. Later I wrote to Kapp instead of to you because Kapp was bombarding me with threatening letters. The draft I gave Kapp wasn’t honoured by Korff. In the meantime I had declared at the shareholders’ meeting that either Korff or I must resign from the paper <span class="context">[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]</span>. Moreover, <em>during this period Plasman</em> had again sequestered the postage money, and the paper, as Engels discovered on his arrival, was expecting to announce its insolvency any day.</p>
<p>3. As regards the Meyerbeer business, I know <em>nothing whatever</em> about it. You will appreciate that in a situation in which the compositors were daily rebelling over a few talers, I would hardly have spurned 150 talers.</p>
<p>4. As regards my letter about Kapp, I was justified in writing it. During the most ghastly period of all, Kapp was threatening to attack us publicly. If you put yourself in <em>our</em> situation at that time, you will understand my vexation. As regards Weerth’s comment (which, by the by, referred <em>not to you, </em>but to <em>Imandt</em>, who was writing to us incessantly), this is the first I have heard of it.</p>
<p>5. As regards the 25 talers remitted on <em>14 January</em>, these were dispatched to you in the presence of witnesses via Ewerbeck’s address. The Post Office here will provide information about this tomorrow. Nota bene: <em>Kapp</em> received 15 talers from me at the same time.</p>
<p>6. As regards my not answering, Lupus will testify that I wrote to you frequently.</p>
<p>7. If the tone of one of my letters was waspish, this was, a) because I was going through an atrociously bad patch with the paper and was under attack from all the paper’s correspondents and creditors, b) because, in a letter to Freiligrath, <em>Imandt</em> depicted you, Kapp, etc., as complaining bitterly about me, while the precious Beust, I think it is <em>Beust </em>(I am not quite sure), was sending similar letters here.</p>
<p>Within a few days the paper must either go under or else <em>consolidate </em>itself, in which case we shall immediately send you more money of which, at the moment, there is a <em>complete </em>lack. However the business of the 25 talers must be cleared up.</p>
<p>That I have constantly regarded you as co-editor of the paper is apparent not only from the new announcement in the various papers <span class="context">[Bestellungen auf die Neue Rheinische Zeitung für das nächste Quartal, Januar bis März 1849]</span> but also from the fact that I placed your article about the expulsion of the Frankfurt refugee <span class="context">[F. Wiedecker]</span> under ‘Cologne’. <span class="context">[E. Dronke, ‘Allianz der europäischen Polizei’, Neue Rheinische Zeitung, 11 January 1849]</span></p>
<p>Your<br>
Marx</p>
