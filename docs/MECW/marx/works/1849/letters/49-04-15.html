<h4>Draft, Cologne, before 15 April 1849</h4>
<p><em>To Colonel Engels, Commandant</em></p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Being convinced that Royal Prussian non-commissioned officers would not deny words spoken in private, I did not call in any <em>witnesses </em>to the conversation in question. As to my alleged remark that ‘<em>the courts, as has recently been seen, can do nothing to me’,</em><sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#254" target=_blank>[254]</a></sup> even my political opponents will concede that, were I to harbour such a foolish thought, I would not express it before a third party. And do not the non-commissioned officers themselves admit that I explained to them that things <em>below the line</em> are no concern of mine and that in any case I am responsible only for the section of the paper signed by me? Hence there was absolutely no reason to speak of my position vis-à-vis the courts.</p>
<p>I am all the happier to refrain from pressing for a further inquiry as it was my concern, not that the non-commissioned officers should be punished, but simply that they should be reminded, from the lips of their superiors, of the limits of their duties.</p>
<p>As for the kind remark with which you conclude, the <em>Neue</em> <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> has demonstrated, by its silence over the recent friction among the military themselves, how great is its consideration for the prevailing mood of unrest.</p>
