<h4>London, 12 August 1873</h4>
<p><em>N. Danielson, Esq.</em></p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have since months suffered severely, and found myself, for some time, even in a dangerous state of illness, consequent upon overwork. My head was so seriously affected, that a paralytic strike was to be apprehended, and even now I am not yet able to work more than a few hours. This is <em>the only reason</em> why I have not before acknowledged, and thanked you for, the precious collection of books you were so kind as to send me. </p>
<p>You will have received — at least I read your last letter in that sense — 3 copies of <em>Das Kapital </em>in one volume. I send you to-day the last <em>livraison</em> of the <em>Heftedition</em>.</p>
<p>We are publishing the Revelations on the <em>Alliance</em>, (you know the sect of teetotallers call themselves thus in England), and want to know the <em>cheapest </em>way to send you a somewhat large number of copies. A letter relative to the chief of that sanctimonious people is still held in reserve.</p>
<p>I thank you much for your last long letter and shall make proper use of it. It is of great commercial value for myself.</p>
<p class="fst">Yours most truly,<br>
A. Williams </p>
