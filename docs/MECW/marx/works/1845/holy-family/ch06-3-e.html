<h1>e) Final Defeat of Socialism</h1>
<p class="quoteb">“The French set up a series of <em>systems</em> of <em>how</em> the <em>mass</em> should be <em>organised</em>, but they had to resort to <em>fantasy</em> because they considered the mass, as it is, to be usable material.”</p>
<p>Actually, the French and the English have proved, and proved in great detail, that the present social system organises the “mass <em>as it is</em>” and is therefore its <em>organisation</em>. <em>Criticism</em>, following the example of the <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em>, disposes of all socialist and communist systems by means of the <em>fundamental</em> word “<em>fantasy</em>”. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#57" target=_blank>[57]</a></sup> Having thus shattered foreign socialism and communism, <em>Criticism</em> transfers its war-like operations to Germany.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“When the <em>German Enlighteners</em> suddenly found themselves disappointed in their hopes of 1842 and, in their embarrassment, did not know <em>what to do, news</em> of the recent <em>French</em> systems came in the nick of time. They were henceforth able to speak of raising the lower classes of the people and at that price they were able to dispense with the question whether they did not themselves belong to the mass, which is to be found not only in the lowest strata.”</p>
<p><em>Criticism</em> has obviously so exhausted its entire provision of well meaning motives in the apologia for Bauer’s literary past that it can find no other explanation for the German socialist movement than the “embarrassment” of the Enlighteners in 1842. “Fortunately they received news of the recent <em>French</em> systems.” Why not of the <em>English</em>? For the decisive <em>Critical</em> reason that Herr Bauer received no news of the recent English systems through Stein’s book: <em>Der Communismus und Socialismus des heutigen Frankreichs</em>. This is also the decisive reason why only <em>French systems </em>ever exist for <em>Criticism</em> in all its talk about socialist systems.</p>
<p>The German Enlighteners, Criticism goes on to explain, committed a sin against the Holy Ghost. They busied themselves with the “lower classes of the people”, already in existence in 1842, in order to get rid of the question, which did not yet exist then, as to what rank they were destined to occupy in the <em>Critical world system</em> that was to be instituted in anno 1843: sheep or goat, Critical Critic or impure Mass, <em>Spirit</em> or <em>Matter</em>. But above all they should have thought seriously of the Critical <em>salvation of their own souls</em>, for of what profit is it to me if I gain the whole world, including the lower classes of the people, and suffer the loss of my own soul?</p>
<p class="quoteb">“But a spiritual being cannot be raised to a higher level unless it is altered, and it cannot be altered before it has experienced extreme resistance.”</p>
<p>Were <em>Criticism</em> better acquainted with the movement of the lower classes of the people it would know that the extreme resistance that they have experienced from practical life is changing them every day. Modern prose and poetry emanating in England and France from the lower classes of the people would show it that the lower classes of the people know how to raise themselves spiritually even without being directly <em>overshadowed</em> by the <em>Holy Ghost of Critical Criticism</em>.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“They,” Absolute Criticism continues to indulge in fancy, “whose <em>whole wealth </em>is the word ‘<em>organisation of the mass'</em>”, etc.</p>
<p>A lot has been said about “organisation of labour”, although even this “catchword” came not from the Socialists themselves but from the politically radical party in France, which tried to be an intermediary between politics and socialism.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#58" target=_blank>[58]</a></sup> But nobody before Critical Criticism spoke of “organisation of the mass” as of a question yet to be solved. It was proved, on the contrary, that <em>bourgeois society, </em>the dissolution of the old <em>feudal</em> society, is this organisation of the mass.</p>
<p><em>Criticism</em> puts its discovery in quotation marks <span class="context">[Gänsefüsse (=goose-feet) is a German word for quotation marks]</span>. The goose that cackled to Herr Bauer the watchword for saving the Capitol<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#59" target=_blank>[59]</a></sup> is none but his <em>own</em> <em>goose, Critical Criticism</em>. It organised the mass anew by speculatively constructing it as <em>the</em> Absolute Opponent of <em>the</em> Spirit. The antithesis between spirit and mass is the Critical “organisation of society”, in which <em>the</em> Spirit, or <em>Criticism</em>, represents the organising <em>work</em>, the mass — the <em>raw material</em>, and history — the <em>product</em>.</p>
<p>After Absolute Criticism’s great victories over revolution, materialism and socialism in its third campaign, we may ask: What is the <em>final result</em> of these Herculean feats? Only that these movements <em>perished</em> without any result because they were still <em>criticism adulterated by mass </em>or <em>spirit adulterated by matter</em>. Even in Herr Bauer’s own literary past <em>Criticism</em> discovered manifold adulterations of criticism by the mass. But <em>here</em> it writes an apologia instead of a criticism, “<em>places in safety</em>” instead of <em>surrendering</em>; instead of seeing in the <em>adulteration of the spirit</em> by the <em>flesh</em> the death of the spirit too, it reverses the case and finds in the adulteration of the <em>flesh by the spirit</em> the life even of <em>Bauer’s</em> flesh. On the other hand, it is all the more ruthless and decisively <em>terroristic</em> as soon as imperfect criticism still adulterated by mass is no longer the <em>work</em> of Herr Bauer but of whole peoples and of a number of ordinary Frenchmen and Englishmen; as soon as imperfect criticism is no longer entitled <em>Die Judenfrage</em>, or <em>Die gute Sache der Freiheit, or Staat, Religion und Parthei</em>, but revolution, materialism, socialism or communism. Thus <em>Criticism</em> did away with the adulteration of spirit by matter and of criticism by mass by sparing its own flesh and crucifying the flesh of others.</p>
<p>One way or the other, the “spirit adulterated by flesh” or “Criticism adulterated by mass” has been cleared out of the way. Instead of this un-Critical adulteration, there appears absolutely Critical <em>disintegration</em> of spirit and flesh, criticism and mass, their pure opposition. This opposition in its <em>world-historic</em> form in which it constitutes the true historical interest of the present time, is the opposition of Herr Bauer and Co., or <em>the</em> Spirit, to the rest of the human race as Matter.</p>
<p>Revolution, materialism and communism <em>therefore</em> have fulfilled their historic mission. By their <em>downfall</em> they have prepared the way for the Critical <em>Lord</em>. Hosanna!</p>
