<h3>f) The Speculative Cycle of Absolute Criticism and the Philosophy of Self-Consciousness</h3>
<p><em>Criticism</em>, having supposedly attained <em>perfection</em> and purity in <em>one</em> domain, <em>therefore</em> committed only one <em>oversight</em> “only” one “inconsistency”, that of not being “pure” and “perfect” in all domains. The “one” Critical domain is none other than that of <em>theology. </em>The <em>pure</em> area of this domain extends from the <em>Kritik der Synoptiker </em>by Bruno Bauer to <em>Das entdeckte Christenthum </em>by Bruno Bauer, as the farthest frontier post.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Modern Criticism,” we are told, “had finally dealt with Spinozism; it was therefore inconsistent of it naively to presuppose Substance in one domain, even if only in individual, falsely expounded points.”</p>
<p><em>Criticism’s</em> earlier admission that it had been involved in political prejudice was immediately followed by the extenuating circumstance that this involvement had been “<em>basically so slight</em>!” Now “the admission of <em>inconsistency</em> is tempered by the parenthesis that it committed only in <em>individual, falsely expounded points</em>. It was not Herr Bauer who was to blame, but the <em>false points</em> which <em>ran away</em> <em>with Criticism</em> like recalcitrant mounts. </p>
<p>A few quotations will show that by overcoming <em>Spinozism Criticism</em> ended up in <em>Hegelian idealism</em>, that from “<em>Substance</em>” it arrive d at another <em>metaphysical monster, the “Subject</em>”,<em> “Substance as a</em> <em>process</em>”,<em> “infinite self-consciousness</em>”,<em> </em>and that the final result of “perfect” and “pure” Criticism is the <em>restoration of the Christian theory of creation </em>in a <em>speculative, Hegelian</em> form.</p>
<p>Let us first open the <em>Kritik der Synoptiker</em>.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Strauss remains true to the view that Substance is the Absolute. Tradition in this form of universality, which has not yet attained the real and rational certitude of universality, that certitude which can be attained only in self-consciousness, in the o~ and infinity of self-consciousness, is nothing but Substance which has emerged from its logical simplicity and has assumed a definite form of existence as the <em>power of the community</em>.” (<em>Kritik der Synoptiker</em>, Vol. I, Preface, pp. vi [-vii]).</p>
<p>Let us leave to their fate “<em>the</em> universality which attains certitude”, the “oneness and infinity” (the Hegelian <em>Notion</em>). — Instead of saying that the view put forward in <em>Strauss’ </em>theory on the “power of the community” and “tradition” has its abstract expression, its logical and metaphysical <em>hieroglyphic</em>, in the Spinozist conception of <em>Substance</em>, Herr Bauer makes “<em>Substance emerge</em> from its <em>logical simplicity</em> and assume a definite form of existence in the power of the community”. He applies the <em>Hegelian</em> miracle apparatus by which the “<em>metaphysical categories</em>” — abstractions extracted out of <em>reality</em> — emerge from <em>logic</em>, where they are dissolved in the “<em>simplicity</em>” of thought, and assume “a definite form” of physical or human existence; he makes them become incarnate. Help, <em>Hinrichs</em>!</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Mysterious,” <em>Criticism</em> continues its argument against Strauss, “mysterious is this view because whenever it wishes to explain and make visible the process to which the gospel history owes its origin, it can only bring out the <em>semblance</em> of a press [... ] The sentence: ‘The gospel history has its source and origin in tradition’, posits the same thing <em>twice</em> — ‘tradition’ and the ‘gospel history'; admittedly it does posit a relation between them, but it does not tell us to what <em>internal process of Substance</em> the development and exposition owe their origin."'</p>
<p>According to <em>Hegel, Substance</em> must be conceived as an <em>internal</em> <em>process. </em>He characterises <em>development</em> from the viewpoint of Substance as follows:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“But if we look more closely at this <em>expansion</em>, we find that it has not come about by one and the same principle taking shape in diverse ways; it is only the shapeless <em>repetition of one and the same thing</em> ... keeping up a tedious <em>semblance</em> of diversity” (<em>Phänomenologie</em>, Preface, p. 12).</p>
<p class="fst">Help, Hinrichs!</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Criticism,” Herr Bauer continues, “according to this, must turn against itself and look for the solution of the <em>mysterious substantiality</em> ... in what the <em>development of Substance itself </em>leads to, in the universality and certitude of the idea and its real existence, in <em>infinite self-consciousness.</em>”</p>
<p class="fst"><em>Hegel’s</em> criticism of the substantiality view continues:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“The compact solidity of Substance is to be opened up and Substance raised to <em>self-consciousness</em>” (loc. cit., p. 7).</p>
<p>Bauer’s <em>self-consciousness, </em>too, is <em>Substance raised </em>to self-consciousness or <em>self-consciousness </em>as <em>Substance</em>; self-consciousness is transformed from an <em>attribute of man</em> into a <em>self-existing subject. </em>This is the <em>metaphysical-theological</em> caricature of man in his <em>severance</em> from nature. The <em>being</em> of this self-consciousness is therefore not <em>man</em>, but <em>the idea</em> of which self-consciousness is the <em>real existence</em>. It is the idea <em>become man</em>, and therefore it is <em>infinite</em>. All <em>human</em> qualities are thus transformed in a <em>mysterious way</em> into qualities of imaginary “<em>infinite self-consciousness</em>”.<em> </em>Hence, Herr Bauer says <em>expressly</em> that <em>everything</em> has its <em>origin</em> and its <em>explanation</em> in this “infinite selfconsciousness”, i.e., finds in it the <em>basis </em>of its <em>existence</em>. Help, <em>Hinrichs</em>!</p>
<p class="fst">Herr Bauer continues:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“The power of the <em>substantiality relation</em> lies in its impulse, which leads us to the concept, the idea and self-consciousness.”</p>
<p class="fst"><em>Hegel</em>. says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Thus the <em>concept</em> is the <em>truth</em> of the substance.” “The transition of the <em>substantiality relation</em> takes place through its own immanent necessity and consists in this only, that <em>the</em> concept is the truth of the substance.” “The <em>idea</em> is the adequate concept.” “The concept ... having achieved <em>free</em> existence ... is nothing but the <em>ego</em> or <em>pure self-consciousness</em>” (<em>Logik</em>, Hegel’s Werke, 2nd ed., Vol. 5, pp. 6, 9, 229, 13).</p>
<p class="fst">Help, <em>Hinrichs</em>!</p>
<p>It seems comic in the extreme when Herr Bauer says in his <em>Literatur-Zeitung</em>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“<em>Strauss</em> came to grief because he was unable to <em>complete the criticism of Hegel’s system</em>, although he proved by his half-way criticism the necessity for its completion”, etc. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#60" target=_blank>[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was not a <em>complete criticism</em> of Hegel’s system that Herr Bauer himself thought he was giving in his <em>Kritik der Synoptiker</em> but at the most the <em>completion of Hegel’s system</em>, at least in its application to theology.</p>
<p>He describes his criticism (<em>Kritik der Synoptiker</em>, Preface, p. xxi) as “the last act of a definite system”, which is no other than <em>Hegel’s</em> system.</p>
<p>The dispute between <em>Strauss</em> and <em>Bauer</em> over <em>Substance</em> and <em>Self-Consciousness </em>is a dispute <em>within Hegelian </em>speculation. In <em>Hegel</em> there are <em>three</em> elements, <em>Spinoza’s Substance</em>, <em>Fichte’s Self-Consciousness</em> <em>and </em>Hegel’s necessarily antagonistic <em>unity</em> of the two, the <em>Absolute Spirit</em>. The first element is metaphysically disguised <em>nature separated</em> from man; the second is metaphysically disguised <em>spirit separated</em> from nature; the third is the metaphysically disguised <em>unity</em> of both, <em>real man</em> and the real <em>human</em> <em>species.</em></p>
<p>Within the domain of theology, <em>Strauss</em> expounds <em>Hegel</em> from <em>Spinoza’s point of view, </em>and Bauer does so from <em>Fichte’s point of view</em>, both quite consistently. They both <em>criticised</em> Hegel insofar as with him each of the two elements was <em>falsified</em> by the other, whereas they carried each of these elements to its <em>one-sided </em>and hence consistent development. —  Both of them therefore go <em>beyond</em> Hegel in their criticism, but both also remain <em>within</em> his speculation and each represents only <em>one</em> side of his system. <em>Feuerbach</em>, who completed and criticised <em>Hegel from Hegel’s point of view </em>by resolving the metaphysical <em>Absolute</em> Spirit into “<em>real man on the basis of nature</em>”, was the first to complete the <em>criticism of religion</em> by sketching in a grand and masterly manner the <em>basic features</em> of the <em>criticism of Hegel’s speculation</em> and hence of <em>all</em> <em>metaphysics</em>.</p>
<p>With Herr Bauer it is, admittedly, no longer the <em>Holy Ghost, </em>but nevertheless <em>infinite self-consciousness </em>that dictates the writings of the evangelist.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“We ought not any longer to conceal the fact that the correct conception of the gospel history also has its <em>philosophical basis, namely, the philosophy of self-consciousness</em>” (Bruno Bauer, <em>Kritik der Synoptiker</em>, Preface, p. xv).</p>
<p>This philosophy of Herr Bauer, the <em>philosophy of self-consciousness,</em> like the <em>results</em> he achieved by his criticism of theology, must be characterised by a few extracts from <em>Das entdeckte Christenthum</em>, his <em>last</em> work on the philosophy of religion.</p>
<p>Speaking of the <em>French materialists</em>, he says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“When the <em>truth</em> of materialism, the <em>philosophy </em>of<em> self-consciousness, </em>is revealed and <em>self-consciousness </em>is recognised as the <em>Universe</em>, as the solution of the riddle of <em>Spinoza’s substance</em> and as the true <em>causa sui</em> <span class="context">[Cause of itself]</span>..., what is the purpose of <em>the Spirit</em>? <em>What is the purpose of self-consciousness</em>? As if <em>self-consciousness</em>, by positing the <em>world</em>, did not posit <em>distinction</em> and did not produce itself in all it produces, since it does away again with <em>the distinction of what it produced from itself</em>, and since, consequently it is itself only in production and in movement — as if self-consciousness in this movement, which is itself, had not its purpose and did not possess itself!” (<em>Das entdeckte Christenthum</em>, p. 113.)</p>
<p class="quoteb">“The French materialists did, indeed, conceive the movement of selfconsciousness as the movement of the universal being, matter, but they could <em>not yet</em> see that the <em>movement of the universe</em> became <em>real</em> for itself and achieved unity with itself <em>only </em>as the <em>movement of self-consciousness</em>” (1. c., pp. [114-] 115).</p>
<p class="fst">Help, <em>Hinrichs</em>!</p>
<p>In plain language the <em>first</em> extract means: the truth of <em>materialism</em> is the <em>opposite </em>of materialism, <em>absolute</em>, i.e., exclusive, unmitigated <em>idealism</em>. Self-consciousness, <em>the Spirit</em>, is the <em>Universe</em>. Outside of it there is <em>nothing</em>. “Self-consciousness”, “<em>the Spirit</em>”, is the almighty creator of the world, of heaven and earth. The <em>world</em> is a manifestation of the life of self-consciousness which has to <em>alienate</em> itself and take on <em>the form of a slave</em>, but the difference between the world and self-consciousness is only an <em>apparent difference</em>. Self-consciousness distinguishes <em>nothing real</em> from itself. The world is, rather, only a metaphysical <em>distinction</em>, a phantom of its ethereal brain and an <em>imaginary</em> product of the latter. Hence selfconsciousness does away again with the appearance, which it conceded for a moment, that something exists outside of it, and it recognises in what it has “produced” no real object, i.e., no object which in reality, is distinct from it. By this movement, however, <em>self-consciousness </em>first produces itself as absolute, for the <em>absolute</em> idealist, in order to be an absolute idealist, must necessarily constantly go through the <em>sophistical process </em>of first transforming the world <em>outside himself</em> into an appearance, a mere fancy of <em>his</em> brain, and afterwards declaring this <em>fantasy</em> to be what it really is, i.e., a mere fantasy, so as finally to be able to proclaim his sole, exclusive existence, which is no longer disturbed even by the semblance of an external world.</p>
<p>In plain language the <em>second</em> extract means: The French materialists did, of course, conceive the movements of matter as movements involving spirit, but they were not yet able to see that they are not <em>material</em> but <em>ideal</em> movements, movements of selfconsciousness, consequently pure movements of thought. They were not yet able to see that the real movement of the universe became true and real only as the <em>ideal</em> movement of selfconsciousness free and freed from <em>matter</em>, that is, from reality; in other words, that a <em>material</em> movement distinct from ideal brain movement exists only in <em>appearance</em>. Help, <em>Hinrichs</em>!</p>
<p>This speculative <em>theory of creation</em> is almost word for word in <em>Hegel; </em>it can be found in his <em>first</em> work, his <em>Phänomenologie</em>.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“The alienation <em>of self-consciousness</em> itself establishes <em>thinghood</em>.... In this alienation self-consciousness establishes itself as object or sets up the object as <em>itself</em>. On the other hand, there is also this other moment in the process that it has just as much <em>abolished</em> this <em>alienation</em> and <em>objectification</em> and resumed them into itself.... This is the <em>movement of consciousness</em>” (Hegel, <em>Phänomenologie</em>, pp. 574-75).</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Self-consciousness has a <em>content</em> which it distinguishes <em>from itself</em>... This content in its <em>distinction</em> is itself the <em>ego</em>, for it is the <em>movement</em> of superseding itself.... More precisely stated, this content is nothing but the <em>very movement just spoken of; </em>for the content is <em>the Spirit</em> which traverses the whole range of its own being, and does this <em>for itself </em>as <em>Spirit</em>” (<em>loc. cit</em>., pp. [582-] 583).</p>
<p class="fst">Referring to this theory of creation of Hegel’s, <em>Feuerbach</em> observes:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Matter is the self-alienation of the spirit. Thereby matter itself acquires spirit and reason — but at the same time it is assumed as a <em>nothingness</em>, an <em>unreal</em> being, inasmuch as being producing itself from this alienation, i.e., being divesting itself of matter, of sensuousness, is pronounced to be being in its perfection, in its true shape and form. Therefore the natural, the material, the sensuous, is what is to he <em>negated</em> here too, as <em>nature poisoned by original sin </em>is in theology” (<em>Philosophie der Zukunft</em> p. 35). </p>
<p>Herr Bauer therefore defends materialism against <em>un-Critical theology</em>, at the same time as he reproaches it with “not yet” being <em>Critical theology, theology of reason, Hegelian speculation</em>. <em>Hinrichs! Hinrichs</em>!</p>
<p>Herr Bauer, who in all domains carries through <em>his</em> opposition to <em>Substance, his philosophy of self-consciousness </em>or of <em>the</em> Spirit, must therefore in all domains have only the <em>figments</em> of his own <em>brain</em> to deal with. In his hands, <em>Criticism</em> is the instrument to sublimate into mere <em>appearance</em> and <em>pure</em> thought all that affirms a <em>finite</em> material existence <em>outside infinite self-consciousness. </em>What he combats in Substance is not the <em>metaphysical illusion</em> but its <em>mundane</em> kernel — <em>nature</em>; nature both as it exists <em>outside</em> man and as man’s nature. Not to presume <em>Substance</em> in any domain — he still uses this language — means therefore for him not to recognise any <em>being</em> distinct from thought, any <em>natural energy</em> distinct from the <em>spontaneity of the spirit</em>, any <em>power of human nature</em> distinct from <em>reason</em>, any <em>passivity</em> distinct from <em>activity</em>, any <em>influence of others</em> distinct from <em>one’s own action</em> any <em>feeling</em> or <em>willing</em> distinct from <em>knowing</em>, any <em>heart</em> distinct from the <em>head</em>, any <em>object</em> distinct from the <em>subject</em>, any <em>practice</em> distinct from <em>theory</em>, any <em>man</em> distinct from the <em>Critic</em>, any <em>real community</em> distinct from <em>abstract generality</em>, any <em>Thou</em> distinct from <em>I</em>. Herr Bauer is therefore consistent when he goes on to identify <em>himself</em> with <em>infinite</em> <em>self-consciousness, </em>with the <em>Spirit</em>, i.e., to replace these creations of his by their creator. He is just as consistent in rejecting as <em>stubborn mass</em> and <em>matter</em> the <em>rest of the</em> <em>world</em> which obstinately insists on being something <em>distinct</em> from what <em>he</em>, Herr Bauer, has produced. And so he hopes:</p>
<p class="quoteb">It will not belong<br>
Before all bodies perish.'<br>
<span class="context">[Goethe, Faust, Part 1, Scene 3]</span></p>
<p>His own ill-humour at so far being unable to master “the <em>something</em> of this <em>clumsy world</em>” he interprets equally consistently as the <em>self-discontent</em> of this world, and the indignation of his Criticism at the development of mankind as the <em>mass-type</em> indignation of mankind against <em>his</em> Criticism, against the Spirit, against Herr Bruno Bauer and Co.</p>
<p>Herr Bauer was a <em>theologian</em> from the very beginning, but no ordinary one; he was a <em>Critical theologian</em> or a <em>theological Critic</em>. While still the extreme representative of <em>old Hegelian</em> orthodoxy who put in a speculative form all <em>religious</em> and <em>theological nonsense</em>, he constantly proclaimed <em>Criticism</em> his <em>private domain</em>. At that time he called <em>Strauss’ </em>criticism <em>human</em> criticism and expressly asserted the right of divine criticism in opposition to it. He later stripped the great <em>self-reliance</em> or<em> self-consciousness, </em>which was the hidden kernel of this divinity, of its religious shell, made it self-existing as an independent being, and raised it, under the trade-mark “<em>Infinite Self-consciousness</em>”,<em> </em>to the rank of the principle of Criticism. Then he accomplished in his own movement the movement that the “philosophy of self-consciousness” describes as the absolute act of life. He abolished anew the “distinction” between “the product”, <em>infinite</em> <em>self-consciousness, </em>and the producer, <em>himself</em>, and acknowledged that infinite self-consciousness in its movement “<em>was only he himself</em>”, and that therefore the movement of the universe only becomes <em>true</em> and <em>real</em> in his ideal self-movement.</p>
<p><em>Divine</em> criticism in its <em>return into itself </em>is restored in a rational, conscious, Critical way; <em>being in-itself</em> is transformed into <em>being in-and-for-itself</em> and only at the <em>end</em> does the fulfilled, realised, revealed <em>beginning</em> take place. <em>Divine</em> criticism, as <em>distinct</em> from <em>human</em> criticism, reveals itself as <em>Criticism, pure Criticism, Critical Criticism</em>. The apologia for the Old and the New Testament is replaced by the apologia for the old and new works of Herr Bauer. The <em>theological</em> antithesis of God and man, spirit and flesh, infinity and finiteness is transformed into the <em>Critical-theological</em> antithesis <em>of the Spirit, Criticism</em>, or Herr <em>Bauer</em>, and the <em>matter</em> of the <em>mass</em>, or the secular world. The theological antithesis of faith and reason has been resolved into the Critical-theological antithesis of <em>common sense</em> and pure Critical thought. The <em>Zeitschrift für spekulative Theologie </em>has been transformed into the Critical <em>Literatur-Zeitung</em>. <em>The religious redeemer of the world</em> has finally become a reality in the <em>Critical redeemer of the world</em>, Herr <em>Bauer</em>.</p>
<p>Herr Bauer’s last stage is not an anomaly in his development; it is the <em>return</em> of his development <em>into</em> itself from its <em>alienation</em>. Naturally, the point at which <em>divine</em> Criticism <em>alienated</em> itself and came out of itself coincided with the point at which it became partly untrue to itself and created something <em>human</em>.</p>
<p>Returning to its starting-point, <em>Absolute Criticism</em> has ended the <em>speculative cycle </em>and thereby its own <em>life’s career</em>. Its further movement is <em>pure</em>, lofty <em>circling within itself</em>, above all interest of a mass nature and therefore devoid of any further interest for the Mass.</p>
