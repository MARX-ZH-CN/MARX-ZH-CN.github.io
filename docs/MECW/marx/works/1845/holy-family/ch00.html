<p class="title">The Holy Family</p>
<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p><em>Real humanism</em> has no more dangerous enemy in Germany than <em>spiritualism</em>
or <em>speculative idealism</em>, which substitutes <em>"self-consciousness"</em>
or the <em>''spirit"</em> for the <em>real individual man</em> and with the
evangelist teaches: "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
nothing." Needless to say, this incorporeal spirit is spiritual only in
its imagination. What we are combating in <em>Bauer's</em> criticism is precisely
<em>speculation</em> reproducing itself as a <em>caricature. </em>We see in
it the most complete expression of the <em>Christian-Germanic</em> principle,
which makes its last effort by transforming <em>"criticism"</em> itself into
a transcendent power.

<p>Our exposition deals first and foremost with <em>Bruno Bauer's Allgemeine
Literatur-Zeitung</em> -- the first eight numbers are here before us --
because in it Bauer's criticism, and with it the nonsense of <em>German
speculation in general,</em> has reached its peak. The more completely Critical
Criticism (the criticism of the <em>Literatur-Zeitung) </em>distorts reality
into an obvious comedy through philosophy, the more instructive it is.
-- For examples see <em>Faucher</em> and <em>Szeliga. </em>-- The <em>Literatur-Zeitung</em>
offers material by which even the broad public can be enlightened on the
illusions of speculative philosophy. That is the aim of our book.

<p>Our exposition is naturally determined by its <em>subject</em>. Critical
Criticism is in all respects <em>below</em> the level already attained by
German theoretical development. The nature of our subject therefore justifies
our refraining <em>here</em> from further <em>discussion</em> of that development
itself.

<p>Critical Criticism makes it necessary rather to assert, in contrast
to it, the already achieved results <em>as such</em>.

<p>We therefore give this polemic as a preliminary to the independent works
in which we -- each of us for himself, of course -- shall present our positive
view and thereby our positive attitude to the more recent philosophical
anti social doctrines.
