<h4>London, 28 November 1867</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong><em>,</em></p>
<p>I see that I did not enclose the 2 letters from Borkheim for you. But it is not really necessary. Yesterday we had the ‘discussion’ he desired. He has reverted to the idea (which I suggested to him 2 months ago) of a loan from the ‘Atlas’ Life Assurance Company, whose secretary is a friend of his. I completed the papers yesterday at his house. You only figure as a <strong>reference</strong> on them. £150 (of which Borkheim would receive £45), repayable on 1 September.</p>
<p>I no longer have any faith in the success of Borkheim’s operations. <em>I have no doubt about his good will.</em></p>
<p>Have you received his ‘<em>Pearl</em>’? (French and German so far).</p>
<p>Important letter from Schily enclosed. Please send it back <em>by return; </em>give your opinion at the same time. Whatever happens I shall not permit Moses to derive ‘profit’ from my work without profiting to some extent from it myself<a name="ireland">.</a></p>
<p>I am having to be diplomatic about Fenianism. I cannot keep entirely silent, but under no circumstances do I want the fellows, when criticising my book <span class="context">[Capital]</span>, to confine themselves to the statement that I am a demagogue.</p>
<p>I am <em>sending </em>you Borkheim’s <em>Gentz </em>(important for the article on Russia) without his knowledge. Please return it to me as soon as you have finished.</p>
<p>I now have a rash of furuncles more or less all over, and am glad of it. It puts paid to the carbuncle malady.</p>
<p><em>Salut.</em></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
Moro</p>
<p>*My compliments to Mrs Burns. Jenny goes in black since the Manchester execution, and wears her Polish cross on a <em>green </em>ribbon.*</p>
