<h4>[London,] 27 June 1867</h4>
<p>Dear <strong>Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>The 2 half £5-notes received with kindest thanks. With respect to the address, use <em>Borkheim. </em>He knows my situation, though with as much concealment as I consider necessary in his regard. I would even like him to know that you are lending me money. But you must write and tell me <em>when </em>the money is to be sent to him. I do not see why I should involve yet a 3rd philistine.</p>
<p>The <em>Fenians</em> should be delivered to you today.</p>
<p>I was so very pleased by your lines of yesterday, and that requires no further elaboration from me.</p>
<p>Sheet 20 <span class="context">[of the first volume of <em>Capital</em>]</span> was the latest to reach me. It will probably run to 40 or 42 sheets in all. I've <em>not</em> as yet received <em>any</em> <em>corrected proofs </em>after the ones already sent you. On your departure send me back those which are in your possession.</p>
<p>Regarding the objection that you mentioned the philistines and vulgar economists will infallibly raise (they forget, of course, that, if they reckon <em>paid labour</em> as <em>wages, </em>they are reckoning <em>unpaid</em> labour as <em>profit</em>, etc.), it amounts, in scientific terms, to the following question:</p>
<p><em>How </em>is the <em>value </em>of the commodity <em>transformed</em> into its <em>price of production</em> in which</p>
<p class="fst">1. the<em> whole of the labour appears paid for</em> in the form of <em>wages;</em></p>
<p class="fst">2. the surplus-labour, however, or the surplus-value, assumes the form of an <em>addition to the price, </em>and goes by the name of interest, profit, etc., <em>over and above </em>the <em>cost-price </em>(= price of the constant part of capital + wages).</p>
<p>Answering this question presupposes:</p>
<p class="fst">I. That the <em>transformation</em> of, for example, the <em>value of a day’s labour-power </em>into<em> wages or the price of a day’s labour</em> has been explained. This is done in <em>Chapter V</em> of this volume.</p>
<p class="fst">II. That the <em>transformation of surplus-value</em> into <em>profit</em>, and of <em>profit into average profit</em>, etc., has been explained. This presupposes that the <em>process of the circulation of capital </em>has been previously explained, since the turnover of capital, etc., plays a part here. This matter cannot therefore be treated prior to the 3rd book <em>(Volume II </em>is to contain books 2 and 3). Here it will be shown how the philistines’ and vulgar economists’ <em>manner of conceiving things</em> arises, namely, because the only thing that is ever reflected in their minds is the immediate <em>form of appearance </em>of relations, and not their <em>inner connection</em>. Incidentally, if the latter were the case, we would surely have no need of <em>science </em>at all.</p>
<p>Now if I wished to <em>refute</em> all such objections in <em>advance, </em>I should spoil the whole dialectical method of exposition. On the contrary, the good thing about this method is that it is constantly <em>setting traps</em> for those fellows which will provoke them into an untimely display of their idiocy.</p>
<p>By the by, Para. 3: ‘<em>The Rate of Surplus Value’,</em> which was the last one you had in your possession, is immediately followed by the Para.: ‘<em>The Working Day’ </em>(struggle for the reduction of working time), whose argument demonstrates <em>ad oculus </em>to what extent those bourgeois gentlemen comprehend the source and nature of their profit in <em>practice. </em>This is also shown in the <em>Senior </em><strong>case</strong>, where your bourgeois assures us that his whole profit and interest derive from the <em>last unpaid hour of labour.</em></p>
<p>Kindest regards to <strong>Mrs</strong> Lizzy.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>You must stop over for a few days here on your journey home.</p>
<p>Apropos. I judged it in every way imprudent to take Mr <em>Meissner </em>into my confidence regarding my private circumstances.</p>
