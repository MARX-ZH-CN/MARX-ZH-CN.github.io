<p class="title">Anti-Dühring by Frederick Engels 1877</p>
<h1>Notes<br>
<em>From Marx-Engels Collected Works</em></h1>
<p class="fst"><a name="n1"></a><span class="term">1</span> <em>Anti-Dühring
is</em> the title under which Engels’ classic work <em>Herrn Eugen
Dühring’s Revolution in Science is</em> widely known.</p>
<a name="001"></a>
<p>The attention of Marx and Engels was first drawn to Dühring when his review
of Volume One of <em>Capital</em> was published in <em>Ergänzungsblätter</em>,
Vol. III, issue No. 3, in December 1867. They expressed a critical attitude
towards him in a number of letters of January to March 1868.</p>
<a name="002"></a>
<p>In the mid-1870s, Dühring exerted quite a significant influence on German
Social-Democrats. The second edition of <em>Kritische Geschichte der
Nationalökonomie und des Sozialismus</em> (November 1875) and the publication
of <em>Cursus der Philosophie als Streng Wissenschaftlicher Weltanschauung und
Lebensgestaltung</em> (the last issue appeared in February 1875) made his views
more popular. His most active followers were Johann Most, Friedrich Wilhelm
Fritzsche and Eduard Bernstein. Even August Bebel came under the influence of
Dühring's views for a short time. In March 1874, two of Bebel's articles about
Dühring published anonymously under the title “Ein neuer
‘Communist’” in the <em>Volksstaat</em>, the central organ of
the Social-Democratic Workers’ Party (Eisenachers), aroused sharp protest
on the part of Marx and Engels.</p>
<a name="003"></a>
<p>The spread of Dühring's views made Liebknecht, on February 1 and April 21,
1875, propose to Engels that they be criticised in the <em>Volksstaat.</em></p>
<a name="004"></a>
<p>Engels criticised Dühring for the first time in February 1876, in an article
“Prussian Vodka in the German Reichstag”, published in
<em>Volksstaat</em> (see present edition, Vol. 24). Later, in his letter to
Marx of May 24, 1876, he writes of the need to initiate a campaign against the
spread of Dühring’s views in Germany. Replying on May 25, Marx supported
Engels’ idea and suggested that, first of all, Dühring himself be sharply
criticised (see present edition, Vol. 45). Engels broke off his work on
<em>Dialectics of Nature</em>, and by May 28 informed Marx of the general plan
and character of the proposed work.</p>
<a name="005"></a>
<p>Engels worked on <em>Anti-Dühring</em> for two years — from late May
1876 to early July 1878. Part I of the book was written mainly between
September 1876 and January 1877. It was published as a series of articles
entitled <em>Herrn Eugen Dühring’s Umwälzung der Philosophie</em> in
<em>Vorwärts</em> in January-May 1877 (Nos. 1-7, 10 and 11, January 3, 5, 7,
10, 12, 14, 17, 24 and 26; Nos. 17, 24 and 25, February 9, 25 and 28; Nos. 36
and 37, March 25 and 28; Nos. 44, 45, 49 and 50, April 15, 18, 27 and 29; Nos.
55 and 56, May 11 and 13). Later, beginning in 1878, with the first separate
edition, the first two chapters of this part were made into an independent
general introduction to all three parts.</p>
<p><a id="006" name="006"></a> </p>
<p>Part II of the book was written mainly between June and August 1877. The
last,<em>x</em> chapter of this part was written by Marx (see this volume, pp.
9, 15). In addition, in his letters to Engels of March 7 and August 8, 1877,
Marx explained a number of economic problems, especially those connected with
Quesnay's <em>Tabkau économique</em>, which was difficult to understand. Engels
also read the whole manuscript of <em>Anti-Dühring</em> to Marx before sending
it to the printers.</p>
<p><a id="007" name="007"></a> </p>
<p>Part II was published under the title <em>Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung
der politischen Oekonomie</em> in <em>Wissenschaftliche Beilage</em> and in the
supplement to <em>Vorwärts</em> from July to December 1877 (No. 87, July 27;
Nos. 93 and 96, August 10 and 17; Nos. 105 and 108, September 7 and 14; No.
127, October 28; Nos. 130 and 139, November 4 and 28; No. 152, December 30).</p>
<p><a id="008" name="008"></a> </p>
<p>Part III of the book was written mainly between August 1877 and April 1878.
It was published as <em>Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung des Sozialismus</em> in
the supplement to <em>Vorwärts</em> in May to July 1878 (Nos. 52 and 61, May 5
and 26; Nos. 64 and 75, June 2 and 28; No. 79, July 7).</p>
<a name="009"></a>
<p>The publication of <em>Anti-Dühring</em> in <em>Vorwärts</em> aroused strong
resistance on the part of Dühring’s followers. At the next congress of
the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, in Gotha from May 27 to 29, 1877, they
attempted to ban the publication of this work in the Party's central organ. It
was due to them that <em>Anti-Dühring</em> was being printed at lengthy
intervals.</p>
<a name="010"></a>
<p>In July 1877, Part I of Engels’ work was published in Leipzig as a
separate pamphlet: <em>Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung der Wissenschaft. 1.
Philosophie.</em> In July 1878, Parts 11 and III were also published as a
separate pamphlet: <em>Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung der Wissenschaft. 11.
Politische Oekonomie. Sozialismus.</em></p>
<a name="011"></a>
<p>The entire work was first published in book form in Leipzig on about July 8,
1878, with a preface by Engels: F. Engels, <em>Herrn Eugen Dühring’s
Umwälzung der Wissenschaft. Philosophie. Politische Oekonomie.
Sozialismus.</em> Its title is an ironical paraphrase of the title of Dühring's
work <em>Carey's Umwälzung der Volkswirtschaftslehre und
Socialwissenschaft.</em> At the end of October 1878, after the Anti-Socialist
Law had been put into force in Germany, <em>Anti-Dühring</em> was banned along
with Engels’ other works. Its second edition appeared in Zurich, in 1886.
The third, revised and supplemented edition was published in Stuttgart, in
1894, i.e., after the Anti-Socialist Law was repealed (1890). This was the last
edition during Engels’ lifetime. The second and third editions bore the
same title. but the subtitle <em>Philosophie. Politische Oekonomie.
Sozialismus</em> was omitted.</p>
<a name="012"></a>
<p>In 1880, at Paul Lafargue's request, Engels used three chapters of
<em>Anti-Dühring</em> (Chapter I of the Introduction and chapters I and 11 of
Part III) to provide a separate popular pamphlet, first published under the
title <em>Socialism Utopian and Scientific</em>, and later as <em>The
Development of Socialism from Utopia to Science</em> (see present edition, Vol.
24).</p>
<a name="013"></a>
<p><em>Anti-Dühring</em> was published in English for the first time in 1907,
in Chicago as F. Engels, <em>Landmarks of Scientific Socialism.
Anti-Dühring.</em> Translated and edited by Austin Lewis. This work has been
repeatedly reprinted.</p>
<a name="014"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n2"></a><span class="term">2</span> At the congress
held in Gotha from May 22 to 27, 1875, the two trends in the German
working-class movement — the Social-Democratic Workers' Party
(Eisenachers), headed by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, and the
Lassallean General Association of German Workers — united into the
Socialist Workers' Party of Germany.</p>
<a name="015"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n3"></a><span class="term">3</span> The reference is in
particular to August Bebel's article "Ein neuer 'Communist'", printed
anonymously in the <em>Volksstaat</em> on March 13 and 20, 1874 with a
favourable review of Dühring's book <em>Cursus der National- und
Sozialökonomie</em>, <em>einschlieslich der Hauptpunkte der Finanzpolitik</em>
and describing Dühring as a supporter of scientific socialism.</p>
<a name="016"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n4"></a><span class="term">4</span> The reference is to
lectures given to the Berlin workers on the solution of social problems, in
July 1876 by Most, who popularised Dühring's views. These lectures came out as
a separate pamphlet in 1876 in Berlin: J. Most, <em>Die Lösung der socialen
Frage.</em> Dühring's views were also actively disseminated by the
Social-Democratic newspaper <em>Berliner Freie Presse.</em> <a name="017"></a>
</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="n5"></a><span class="term">5</span> This refers to the
protest lodged by Most with the editors of the <em>Volksstaat</em>, who did not
print his article praising Dühring and Fritzsche's speech at the regular
congress of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany in August 1876, demanding
that the Party's central organ <em>Volksstaat</em> disseminate Dühring's
ideas.</p>
<a name="018"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n6"></a><span class="term">6</span> The Sixth World
Industrial Fair opened in Philadelphia on May 10, 1876 in connection with the
centenary of the founding of the USA (July 4, 1776). Reuleaux, director of the
Berlin Industrial Academy appointed by the German Government as chairman of the
German panel of judges, had to admit that German-made goods were far inferior
to those of other countries and that German industry's guiding principle was
"cheap and nasty". This statement evoked wide comment in the press. From July
to September, the <em>Volksstaat</em>, for instance, published a series of
articles on this scandalous fact.</p>
<a name="019"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n7"></a><span class="term">7</span> The phrase "really
never learnt a word", which gained wide currency, is to be found in a letter by
the French Admiral de Panat. It is sometimes ascribed to Talleyrand. It was
made with reference to the royalists, who proved incapable of drawing any
lessons from the French Revolution of the late 18th century.</p>
<a name="020"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n8"></a><span class="term">8</span> The
<em>Anti-Socialist Law</em> was passed by the German Reichstag on October 21,
1878, to counter the socialist and working-class movement. Extended in 1881,
1884, 1886, 1888, it banned all party organisations, mass workers'
organisations and the socialist and labour press; Social-Democrats were
subjected to reprisals. The Social-Democratic Party, with the help of Marx and
Engels, managed, however, to overcome the opportunist (Hochberg, Bernstein and
others) and "ultra-Left" (Most and others) tendencies in its ranks and, while
the law was in force, correctly combined legal and illegal work to strengthen
and extend its influence considerably among the masses. The law was abrogated
on October 1, 1890. Engels assesses it in the article "Bismarck and the German
Working Men's Party" for <em>The Labour Standard</em>.</p>

<a name="024"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n12"></a><span class="term">12</span> In July 1877,
Dühring was deprived of the right to lecture at Berlin University for his sharp
criticism of university practices. His dismissal sparked off a vociferous
protest campaign by his supporters and was condemned by broad democratic
circles.</p>
<a name="025"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n13"></a><span class="term">13</span> Initially, the

introduction to his fundamental work on agrochemistry, Justus Liebig speaks of
the evolution of his scientific views and notes: "Chemistry is moving forward
at an incredible speed, and the chemists wishing to keep up with it are in a
state of constant moulting. One sheds one's old feathers, no longer suitable
for flight, but new ones grow in their stead and one flies all the better." See

theory expounded by Rudolf Virchow in <em>Die Cellularpathologie</em>, first
published in 1858, the individual animal breaks up into tissue, the tissue into
cell-states, and the cell-states into cells, so that, in the final analysis,
the individual animal is a mechanical sum of separate cells.</p>
<a name="033"></a>
<p class="fst">Speaking of the "progressive" nature of this theory, Engels
alludes to Virchow's membership of the German bourgeois Party of Progress,
organised in June 1861. p. I}</p>

<p class="fst">The existence of incandescent masses of gas was proved in 1864
by the English astronomer William Huggins, who made widespread use of the
method of spectral analysis (evolved in 1859 by Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert
Bunsen) in astronomy. Here Engels used A. Secchi's <em>Die Sonne</em>,

<em>Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy</em>, Engels
wrote the following on the Copernican system: "For three hundred years the
Copernican solar system was a hypothesis with a hundred, a thousand or ten
thousand chances to one in its favour, but still always a hypothesis. But when
Leverrier, by means of the data provided by this system, not only deduced the
necessity of the existence of an unknown planet, but also calculated the
position in the heavens which this planet must necessarily occupy, and when
Galle really found this planet, the Copernican system was proved". The planet
mentioned in the quotation is Neptune, which was discovered in 1846 by Johann
Galle of the Berlin Observatory.</p>

bank-notes by Law's bank was accompanied by the withdrawal of coins from

later under the signature of Wagener. This gave Dühring grounds for initiating
proceedings against Wagener on a charge of breaking copyright laws. In 1868,

<p class="fst"><a name="n101"></a><span class="term">101</span> The <em>Reign
of Terror</em> — the period of Jacobin revolutionary-democratic
dictatorship (June 1793-July 1794), which relied on the revolutionary bloc of
the urban petty and middle bourgeoisie, the majority of the peasants and
plebeians.</p>
<a name="140"></a>
<p class="fst">The <em>Directorate</em> — the organ of executive power in
France (from November 1795), formed under the 1795 Constitution. Existing until
the Napoleon's <em>coup d'état</em> of November 9 (18 Brumaire), 1799 it upheld
the interests of big bourgeoisie and brutally suppressed the revolutionary
actions of the popular masses.</p>
<a name="141"></a>
<p class="fst">In 1804, Bonaparte, who actually became the head of the state
under the Consulate after 18 Brumaire, was proclaimed Emperor of the French.</p>
<a name="142"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n102"></a><span class="term">102</span> A reference to
the slogan "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" current during the French
Revolution.</p>
<a name="143"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n103"></a><span class="term">103</span> Saint-Simon's
first work, <em>Lettres d'un habitant de Genève à ses contemporains</em> was
written in Geneva in 1802 and published anonymously in Paris in 1803, without
the place and date of publication being indicated. When working on
<em>Anti-Dühring</em>, Engels made use of: G. Hubbard, <em>Saint-Simon. Sa vie
et ses travaux. Suivi de fragments des plus célèbres écrits de
Saint-Simon</em>, Paris, 1857. This edition contains inaccuracies regarding the
publication dates of various works by Saint-Simon.</p>
<a name="144"></a>
<p class="fst">The first most important work of Charles Fourier was <em>Théorie
des quatre mouvements et des destinées générales</em>, written in the early
nineteenth century and published anonymously in Lyons in 1808 (the title page
gives Leipzig as the place of publication).</p>
<a name="145"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n104"></a><span class="term">104</span> The allied
armies of the sixth anti-French coalition (Russia, Austria, Britain, Prussia
and other countries) entered Paris on March 31, 1814. Napoleon's empire fell
and Napoleon himself, after abdicating, was banished to the Island of Elba. The
Bourbon monarchy was restored in France for the first time (1814-15).</p>
<a name="146"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n105"></a><span class="term">105</span> The <em>Hundred
Days</em> — the period of brief restoration of the Napoleonic Empire
— from the day of Napoleon's return from exile on Elba to Paris on March
20, 1815, until his second abdication on June 22 of the same year, after his
army's defeat at Waterloo on June 18, 1815 by Anglo-Dutch forces under
Wellington and by the Prussian army under Blücher.</p>
<a name="147"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n106"></a><span class="term">106</span> After Dühring
had been deprived of the right to lecture at Berlin University for criticising
university practices and attacking such prominent scientists as Helmholtz,
Virchow and others, a just campaign, in the columns of the Social-Democratic
press included, grew into an unrestrained apologia for Dühring, owing to the
efforts of his supporters. This is what Engels is hinting at. Dühring's attacks
on the German Social-Democrats in reactionary newspapers, in the autumn of the
same year led, however, to a fall in his authority and influence not only among
socialists, but also among people of progressive views in general.</p>
<a name="148"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n107"></a><span class="term">107</span> This idea had
been enunciated in Charles Fourier's first book — <em>Théorie des quatre
mouvements</em> — which contains the following general thesis: "Social
progress and changes of a period are accompanied by the progress of women
towards freedom, while the decay of the social system brings with it a
reduction of the freedoms enjoyed by women." Fourier concludes: "Extension of
the rights of women is the basic principle of all social progress" (Fourier,
<em>Oeuvres complètes</em>, t. I, Paris, 1841, pp. 195-96). p. 248</p>
<a name="149"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n108"></a><span class="term">108</span> In a note to
the relevant passage in <em>Socialism Utopian and Scientific</em>, Engels gives
the source of the last three quotations: R. Owen, <em>The Revolution in the
Mind and Practice of the Human Race; or</em>, <em>the Coming Change from
Irrationality to Rationality</em>, London, 1849, pp. 21, 22. The facts from
Owen's biography mentioned above are from the same source.</p>
<a name="150"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n109"></a><span class="term">109</span> The Bill moved
on Owen's initiative in June 1815, was passed by Parliament only in July 1819,
having been greatly curtailed. The Act regulating labour in cotton mills banned
the employment of children under the age of nine, limited the working day to 12
hours for young people under 18 and established for all workers two breaks, one
for breakfast and the other for lunch. with a total duration of one and a half
hours.</p>
<a name="151"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n110"></a><span class="term">110</span> A Congress of
Co-operative Societies and Trades Unions, presided over by Owen, was held in
London in October 1833. This Congress formally founded the Grand National
Consolidated Trades Union, the Charter of which was adopted in February 1834.
It was Owen's intention that this Union would take over the management of
production and remake society peacefully. This utopian plan collapsed very
soon. In the face of strong opposition from employers and the state, the Union
ceased to exist in 1834.</p>
<a name="152"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n111"></a><span class="term">111</span> <em>Equitable
Labour Exchange Bazaars</em> were founded by workers' co-operatives in various
towns of England; the first of these bazaars was founded by Owen in London in
September 1832 and existed until mid-1834.</p>
<a name="153"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n112"></a><span class="term">112</span> The reference
is to Proudhon's idea of organising an exchange bank, first put forward in his
pamphlet <em>Organisation du Crédit et de la Circulation et Solution du
problème sociale</em>, which was published in early April 1848. This idea was
developed in detail in his other works. Proudhon's main idea was to replace
gold and silver as a means of circulation, with bank-notes, which were, in
fact, impersonal bills. These bank-notes of the exchange bank were secured by
products of labour and, in this, according to Proudhon, lay their principal
difference from other paper money issued by banks and secured by precious
metals, landed property, etc.</p>
<a name="154"></a>
<p class="fst">To put this idea into practice, the Banque du peuple was founded
in Paris on January 31, 1849. It went bankrupt, however, and closed in early
April 1849.</p>
<a name="155"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n113"></a><span class="term">113</span>
<em>Harmon</em>y <em>Hall</em> — the name of the communist community
founded by English utopian socialists, led by Owen, at the close of 1839 in
Queenwood, Hampshire, England. It existed until 1845.</p>
<a name="156"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n114"></a><span class="term">114</span> In
<em>Socialism Utopian and Scientific</em>, Engels gives a note referring to his
work <em>The Mark</em> (see <em>MECW</em>, Vol. 24).</p>
<a name="157"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n115"></a><span class="term">115</span> This refers to
the wars between the major European powers in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries for control of trade with India and America and for seizure of
colonial markets. The principal rivals were initially England and Holland,
later England and France. England won these wars and, towards the close of the
eighteenth century, almost all world trade was concentrated in her hands.</p>
<a name="158"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n116"></a><span class="term">116</span> The reference
is to the Prussian Royal Maritime Company, which was founded as a commercial
and banking company in 1772 and granted a number of important privileges by the
state. It advanced big loans to the government and, in fact, became its banker
and broker.</p>
<a name="159"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n117"></a><span class="term">117</span> The slogan
<em>"a free people's state" — is</em> criticised in section IV of Marx's
<em>Critique of the Gotha Programme</em>, Engels' letter to August Bebel of
March 18-28, 1875, and Lenin's <em>The State and Revolution</em>, Chapter 1,
Paragraph 4, and Chapter IV, Paragraph 3 <em>(Collected Works</em> Vol. 25, pp.
395-401 and 439-42).</p>
<a name="160"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n118"></a><span class="term">118</span> These figures
are from Robert Giffen's paper "Recent Accumulations of Capital in the United
Kingdom", read at the Statistical Society on January 15, 1878 and printed in
the London <em>Journal of the Statistical Society</em> in March 1878.</p>
<a name="161"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n119"></a><span class="term">119</span> Speaking about
the "German Empire of the Prussian nation", Engels underlines, on the one hand,
that the country's unification under Prussian supremacy was completed by
Bismarck on a militaristic basis and, on the other, alludes to the name "the
Holy Roman Empire of the German nation" which, from the end of the fifteenth
century until its formal liquidation in 1806, was part of the archaic state
formation, the mediaeval feudal empire, founded in 962 by the German king Otto
I and embracing the territory of Germany and several other Central European
states. The empire was a precarious unity of feudal principalities and free
towns recognising the supreme power of an emperor.</p>
<a name="162"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n120"></a><span class="term">120</span> Engels had in
mind a speech delivered by Bismarck in the Lower Chamber of the Prussian
Landtag on March 20, 1852, stating that, if there were another upsurge of the
revolutionary movement, large towns, as centres of the revolutionary movement,
ought to be wiped out from the face of the earth.</p>
<a name="163"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n121"></a><span class="term">121</span> The ledger
<em>(Kommerzbuch) </em>is<em></em> described by Wilhelm Weitling in
<em>Garantien der Harmonie und Freiheit</em>, Section II, Ch. 10, Vivis, 1842.
According to Weitling's utopian plan, in the future society, every able-bodied
person would have to work a certain number of hours a day and, in return, would
receive the necessary means of subsistence. Every person would have the right
to work several "commercial hours" over and above this time and, in return, to
receive luxury items, different entertainments, theatre and concert tickets,
etc. These additional working hours and the products received for them would be
recorded in a ledger.</p>
<a name="164"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n122"></a><span class="term">122</span> <em>Non
olet</em> (it {money} does not stink): these words were spoken by the Roman
Emperor Vespasian (69-79 A.D.) in reply to his son, who reproached him for
introducing a tax on lavatories.</p>
<a name="165"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n123"></a><span class="term">123</span> <em>Equitable
Labour Exchange Bazaars</em> were founded by workers' co-operatives in various
towns of England; the first of these bazaars was founded by Owen in London in
September 1832 and existed until mid-1834.</p>
<a name="166"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n124"></a><span class="term">124</span> A detailed
criticism of the Lassallean slogan of "full" or unlimited "proceeds of labour"
is given in Section 1 of Marx's <em>Critique of the Gotha Programme</em>.</p>
<a name="167"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n125"></a><span class="term">125</span> In the original
<em>"Zarücker"</em> — from the German <em>zurück</em> (<em>zarück</em>
— in Berlin dialect), meaning "retrograde person", "reactionary"
("Rückschrittler", "Reaktionär"). See A. Glassbrenner, <em>Herr Buffe</em>,
<em>in der Zarück-Gesellschaft</em> in: <em>Berlin wie es ist und —
trinkt</em>, Leipzig, 1848, pp. 14-15.</p>
<a name="168"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n126"></a><span class="term">126</span> An expression
from the resolution written by Prussian King Frederick II on July 22, 1740 in
reply to an inquiry from Minister von Brand and President of the Consistory
Reichenbach as to whether Catholic schools might be permitted in a Protestant
Prussian state.</p>
<a name="169"></a>
<p class="fst"><a name="n127"></a><span class="term">127</span> <em>May
laws</em> — four laws on creed adopted on Bismarck's initiative in May
1873. These laws established rigid state control over the Catholic Church and
were the culmination of Bismarck's so-called drive for culture from 1872 to
1875, which was directed against the Catholic clergy as the mainstay of the
"Centre" party, representing the interests of the separatists in South and
South-western Germany. Police persecution met with desperate resistance by
Catholics and brought them the halo of martyrdom. From the late 1870s, in order
to unite all the reactionary forces against the working-class movement,
Bismarck's government was compelled first to relax and then to repeal almost
all the anti-Catholic laws.</p>

Flute</em> — a Mozart opera with a libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder.
Composed and performed in 1791, it mirrored Masonic ideas; both the author of
the libretto and Mozart himself having been Masons.</p>
