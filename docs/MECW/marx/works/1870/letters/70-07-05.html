<h4>July 5, 1870</h4>
<p class="fst">Chernyshevsky, I learnt from Lopatin, was sentenced in 1864 to eight years’ <em>travaux forcés</em> in the Siberian mines; so he has another two years to serve. The first court was decent enough to declare that there was absolutely <em>nothing </em>against him and that the alleged secret conspiratorial letters were obvious <em>forgeries </em>(which, indeed, they were). But, by order of the Tsar, the <em>Senate </em>overruled this judgment and sent the cunning man, who is “so skilful,” as the sentence puts it, “that he keeps his works in a legally invulnerable form and yet openly pours out poison in them,” to Siberia. <em>Voilà la justice russe.</em></p>
<p>Flerovsky is in a better position. He is simply in administrative exile in some miserable little place between Moscow and St. Petersburg.</p>
