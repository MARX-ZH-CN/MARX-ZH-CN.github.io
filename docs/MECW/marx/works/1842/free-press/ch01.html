<h3>[Prussian Censorship]</h3>
<h4><em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>
<br>
No. 125, Supplement
<br>
May 5 1842
</h4>
<p class="pagenoteb">
The very first article by Marx in this newspaper was about the freedom
of the press debates in the Rhineland province of Prussia. It appeared
in issue No. 125, on May 5, 1842 — Marx's 24th birthday.
</p>
<p class="pagenoteb">
All these articles were signed: "By a Rhinelander."
They received a very positive response in the progressive German community.
Manager of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> told Marx: "Your articles on freedom
of the press are extremely good.... Meyen wrote that the <em>Rheinische
Zeitung</em> had eclipsed the <em>Deutsche Jahrbucher</em>... that everyone
in Berlin was overjoyed by it." The <em>Deutsche Jahrbucher</em> itself wrote
of them: "Nothing more profound and more substantial has been said or could
have been said on freedom of the press and in defence of it."
</p>
<hr class="end"/>
<p>To the amazement of all writing and reading
Germany the <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em> one fine Berlin spring morning
published its <em>self-confession</em>. <a href="#A" name="Aa"><sup class="ednote">[A]</sup></a>
 Of course, it chose an elegant, diplomatic,
not exactly amusing, form for its confession. It gave itself the appearance
of wanting to hold up the mirror for its sisters to recognise themselves;
it spoke mysteriously only about other <a href="../../../../../glossary/places/p/r.html#prussia" target=_blank>Prussian</a> newspapers, while it was
really speaking about the Prussian newspaper par <em>excellence,</em> itself.
</p>
<p>This fact allows of many different explanations. <em>Caesar</em>
spoke about himself in the third person. Why should the <em>Preussische
Staats-Zeitung,</em> in speaking about third persons, not mean itself? Children,
when speaking about themselves, are in the habit of saying not "I", but
"George", etc. Why should not the <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em> be
allowed to use for its "I" <em>the Vossische, <a href="#B" name="Ba"><sup class="ednote">[B]</sup></a>
 Spenersche</em>, <a href="#C" name="Ca"><sup class="ednote">[C]</sup></a>
 or some other
saint's name?
</p>
<p>The new censorship instruction had appeared. Our newspapers believed
they had to adopt the outward appearance and conventional forms of freedom.
The <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em>, too, was compelled to awake and
have some kind of liberal — or at least independent — ideas.
</p>
<p>The first essential condition for freedom, however, is self-knowledge,
and self-knowledge is an impossibility without self-confession.
</p>
<p>Hence one should firmly keep in mind that the <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung
</em>has written <em>self-confessions;</em> one should never forget that we
see here the first awakening to self-consciousness of a semi-official press-child,
and then all riddles will be solved. One will be convinced that the <em>Preussische
Staats-Zeitung</em> "utters with composure many a great word", and will
only remain undecided whether one should admire more the composure of its
greatness or the greatness of its composure.
</p>
<p>Hardly had the censorship instruction appeared, hardly had the
<em>Staats-Zeitung</em> recovered from this blow, before it came out with
the question: "What use has the greater freedom from censorship been to
you Prussian newspapers?"
</p>
<p>Obviously, what it means to say by this is: What use have the
many years of strict observance of the censorship been to me? What have
I become, in spite of the most scrupulous and thoroughgoing supervision
and tutelage? And what should now become of me? I have not learnt to walk
and a sensation-loving public is expecting entrechats from one who has
a dislocated hip-joint. So will it be for you, too, my sisters! Let us
confess our weaknesses to the Prussian people, but let us be diplomatic
in our confession. We shall not tell them outright that we are uninteresting
for their newspapers.
</p>
<p>We shall tell them that if the Prussian newspapers are uninteresting
for the Prussian people, the Prussian state is uninteresting for the newspapers.
</p>
<p>The bold question of the <em>Staats-Zeitung</em> and the still bolder
answer are mere preludes to its awakening, dream-like allusions in the
text to the role that it will perform. It is awakening to consciousness,
it is speaking its mind. Listen to Epimenides!
</p>
<p>It is well known that the first theoretical activity of the mind
limit still wavers between sensuous perception and thinking is <em>counting.</em>
Counting is the first free theoretical mental act of <em>the child. Let
us count</em>, the <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em> calls to its sisters.
<em>Statistics</em> is the premier political science! I know a man's head
when I know how many hairs grow on it.
</p>
<p>Do as you would be done by. And how could one better us and especially
me, the <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung,</em> than statistically! Statistics
will not merely prove that I appear as often as any French or English newspaper,
but also that I am less read than any newspaper in the civilised world.
Discount the officials who half-heartedly have to be interested in me,
subtract the public places which must have a semi-official organ, and who
reads me, I ask, who? Calculate what I cost; calculate the income I receive,
and you will admit that it is not a profitable business to utter great
words with composure. See how cogent statistics are, how counting makes
more far-reaching mental operations superfluous! Therefore count! Numerical
tables instruct the public without exciting their emotions.
</p>
<p>And the <em>Staats-Zeitung</em> with the importance it attaches
to statistics not only puts itself on a par with the Chinese and with the
universal statistician Pythagoras! <a href="#D" name="Da"><sup class="ednote">[D]</sup></a>
 It shows that it has been influenced
by the great natural philosopher of recent times, <a href="#E" name="Ea"><sup class="ednote">[E]</sup></a>
 who wanted to represent
the differences between animals, etc., by a series of numbers.
</p>
<p>Thus the <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em> is not without modern
philosophical foundations, in spite of its apparent positivism. <a href="#F" name="Fa"><sup class="ednote">[F]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The <em>Staats-Zeitung</em> is many-sided. It does not stop at number,
temporal magnitude. It carries the recognition of the quantitative principle
further and proclaims the justification of spatial magnitude. Space is
the first thing whose magnitude impresses the <em>child. </em>It is the first
magnitude which the child encounters in the world. Hence the child holds
a big man to be a great man, and in the same childish way the <em>Staats-Zeitung</em>
informs us that thick books are incomparably better than thin ones, and
much more so than single leaflets or newspapers, which produce only one
printed sheet daily.
</p>
<p>You Germans can only express yourselves at great length! Write
really voluminous books on the organisation of the state, books of solid
learning, which no one reads except the Herr Author and the Herr Reviewer,
but bear in mind that your newspapers are not books. Think how many printed
sheets go to make a solid work of three volumes! Therefore do not seek
the spirit of our day or time in newspapers, which offer you statistical
tables, but seek it in books, whose size guarantees their solidity.
</p>
<p>Bear in mind, you good children, that it is a matter here of "learned"
things. Study in the school of thick books and you will quickly get to
love us newspapers on account of our flimsy format, our gentlemanly lightness,
which is truly refreshing after the thick books.
</p>
<p>Of course! Of course! Our time has no longer that real taste for
size that we admire in the Middle Ages. Look at our paltry little pietistic
tracts, look at our philosophical systems in small octavo, and then cast
your eyes on the twenty gigantic folios of Duns Scotus. You do not need
to read the books; their exciting aspect suffices to touch your heart and
strike your senses, something like a Gothic cathedral. These primitive
gigantic works materially affect the mind; it feels oppressed under their
mass, and the feeling of oppression is the beginning of awe. You do not
master the books, they master you. You are an unimportant appendage to
them, and in the same way, in the view of the <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em>,
the people should be an unimportant appendage of their political literature.
</p>
<p>Thus the <em>Staats-Zeitung</em>, although its language is quite
modern, is not without historical foundations belonging to the sterling
period of the Middle Ages.
</p>
<p>If, however, the theoretical thinking of the <em>child</em> is quantitative,
its judgment, like its practical thought, is primarily practical and sensuous.
The sensuous quality of the child is the first link that connects it with
the world. The practical organs <em>of senses, </em>primarily the nose and
mouth, are the first organs by means of which it <em>judges</em> the world.
Hence the childish <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em> judges the value of
newspapers, and therefore its own value, by means of its <em>nose.</em> If
a Greek thinker <a href="#G" name="Ga"><sup class="ednote">[G]</sup></a>
 held that dry souls were the best, <a href="#H" name="Ha"><sup class="ednote">[H]</sup></a>
 the <em>Staats-Zeitung
</em>holds that "pleasant-smelling" newspapers are "<em>good</em>" newspapers.
It cannot praise too highly the "<em>literary fragrance</em>" of the Augsburg
<em>Allgemeine</em> and the journal <em>des Débats.</em> Rare, praiseworthy
naivety! Great Pompey, greatest of all!
</p>
<p>After allowing us, therefore, a deep insight into the state of
its soul by means of a number of separate praiseworthy utterances, <em>the
Staats-Zeitung</em> sums up its view of the state in a profound reflection,
the crux of which is the great discovery:

<p class="quote">"that in Prussia the state administration and the whole organisation
of the state are remote from the political spirit, and therefore cannot
be of political interest either to the people or to the newspapers".
</p>
<p>
In the <em>opinion</em> of the <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em>, therefore,
in Prussia the state administration has no political spirit, or the political
spirit has no state administration. How crude of the <em>Staats-Zeitung</em>
to assert what the bitterest opponent could not express more brutally,
namely, that the real life of the state is without any political spirit,
and that the political spirit does not live in the real state!
</p>
<p>But we ought not to forget the <em>childish-sensuous</em> standpoint
of the <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung.</em> It tells us that in regard to
railways one should think only of rails and ways, in regard to trade contracts
only of sugar and coffee, and in regard to leather factories only of leather.
The child, of course, does not go beyond <em>sensuous perception,</em> it
sees a thing only in isolation, and the invisible nerve threads which link
the particular with the universal, which in the state as everywhere make
the material parts into soul-possessing members of the spiritual whole,
are for the child non-existent.
</p>
<p>The child believes that the sun revolves around the earth; that
the universal revolves around the particular. Hence the child does not
believe in the spirit, but it believes in <em>spectres.</em>
</p>
<p>Thus the <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em> regards the political
spirit as a French spectre; and it thinks it exorcises the spectre if it
throws leather, sugar, bayonets and numbers at it.
</p>
<p>However, our reader will interrupt us, we wanted to discuss the
"Rhine Province Assembly proceedings" and instead we are being presented
with the "innocent angel", that senile child of the press, the <em>Preussische
Staats-Zeitung</em>, and a repetition of the old-time lullabies with which
it again and again tries to lull itself and its sisters into wholesome
hibernation.
</p>
<p>But does not Schiller say:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">"But what the sage's reason fails to see
<br>A childish nature grasps in all simplicity." <a href="#I" name="Ia"><sup class="ednote">[I]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The <em>Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em> "in all simplicity" has reminded
us that we in Prussia, no less than in England, have <em>assemblies of the
estates,</em> whose proceedings the daily press would indeed be <em>allowed</em>
to discuss, if it <em>could</em>; for the <em>Staats-Zeitung</em> in its great,
classical self-consciousness takes the view that what the Prussian newspapers
lack is not permission but ability. We concede it the latter as its special
privilege, while at the same time, without further explanation of its ability,
we take the liberty of actually implementing the idea it had in all simplicity.
</p>
<p>The publication of the Assembly proceedings will only become a
reality when they are treated as "<em>public facts", </em>i.e., as subject-matter
for the press. The last <em>Rhine</em> Province Assembly is the one with
which we are most immediately concerned.
</p>
<p>We begin with its <em>"Debates on Freedom of the Press" </em>and
must remark as a preliminary that, while we sometimes give our own positive
view of this question as a participant, in later articles we shall follow
and present the course of the proceedings more as a historical spectator.
</p>
<p>The nature of the proceedings themselves determines this difference
in the method of presentation. For in all the other debates we find that
the various opinions of the Assembly representatives are on about the same
level. In the question of the press, on the other hand, the opponents of
a free press have a considerable advantage. Apart from the catchwords and
commonplaces which fill the air, we find among these opponents of press
freedom a <em>pathological emotion</em>, a passionate partisanship, which
gives them a real, not an imaginary, attitude to the press, whereas the
defend<em>ers </em>of the press in this Assembly have on the whole no real
relation to what they are defending. They have never come to know freedom
of the press as a vital need. For them it is a matter of the head, in which
the heart plays no part. For them it is an "exotic" plant, to which they
are attached by mere "sentiment". Hence it happens that all too general,
vague arguments are put forward to counter the especially "weighty" grounds
of the opponents, and the most narrow-minded idea is held to be important
as long as it is not demolished.
</p>
<p>Goethe once said that the painter succeeds only with a type of
feminine beauty which he has loved in at least one living being. <a href="#J" name="Ja"><sup class="ednote">[J]</sup></a>
 Freedom
of the press, too, has its beauty — if not exactly a feminine one — which
one must have loved to be able to defend it. If I truly love something,
I feel that its existence is essential, that it is something which I need,
without which my nature can have no fall, satisfied, complete existence.
The above-mentioned defenders of freedom of the press seem to enjoy a complete
existence even in the absence of any freedom of the press.

Marx cited mainly from this article, and also from two other articles, "Die Wirkung der Zensur-Verfügung vom 24. Dezember 1841" and "Die Besprechung inlandischer Angelegenheiten," published in the same newspaper in Nos. 75 and 78, March 16 and 19, 1842, respectively

 Marx ironically compares Prussian officialdom's enthusiasm for statistics with the ancient philosophical systems which assigned a special importance to signs and numbers. He hints in particular at the ancient Chinese "I Ching" writings, of which Confucius was considered in the nineteenth century to be one of the first commentators. According to the philosophical conception laid down in them, ku signs, which were formed from various combinations of three continuous or broken lines, symbolised things and natural phenomena.</p><p>
  When calling Pythagoras the "universal statistician" Marx had in mind the ancient Greek philosophers' conceptions of number as the essence of all things.
