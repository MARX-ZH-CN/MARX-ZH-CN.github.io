On Freedom of the Press
</p>
<h3>[On the Assembly of the Estates]</h3>
<hr class="end"/>
<p>The speaker from the knightly estate, to
whom we now come, wages his polemic not against the peoples, but against
persons. He questions <em>human freedom</em> in <em>freedom of the press,
</em>and law in the law <em>of the press.</em> Before dealing with the actual
question of freedom of the press, he takes up the question of <em>unabridged
and daily publication of the Assembly debates. </em>We shall follow him
step by step.</p>
<p class="quote">"The first of the proposals for <em>publication of our proceedings</em>
suffices." "Let it be in the <em>hands of the Provincial Assembly</em> to
make a <em>wise use</em> of the permission granted."</p>
<p>
That is precisely the <em>punctum quaestionis.</em> <a href="#1" name="a1"><sup class="ednote">[A]</sup></a> The province believes that the Provincial Assembly will be under its control
only when the publication of the debates is no longer left to the arbitrary
decision of the Assembly in its wisdom, but has become a legal necessity.
We should have to call the new concession a new step backwards if it had
to be interpreted in such a way that publication depends on an arbitrary
decision by the Assembly of the Estates.</p>
<p><em>Privileges of the estates are in no way rights of the province</em>.
On the contrary, the rights of the province cease when they become privileges
of the estates. Thus the estates of the Middle Ages appropriated for themselves
all the country's constitutional rights and turned them into privileges
against the country.</p>
<p>The citizen does not want to have anything to do with right as
a privilege. Can he regard it as a right if new privileged persons are
added to the old ones?</p>
<p>In this way, the rights of the Provincial Assembly are no longer
<em>rights of the province</em>, but <em>rights against the province</em>,
and the Assembly itself would be the <em>greatest wrong against the province</em>
but with the mystical significance of being supposed to embody its greatest
right.</p>
<p>How greatly the <em>speaker from the knightly estate</em> is imbued
with this medieval conception of the Assembly, how unreservedly he upholds
the privilege of the estate against the rights of the province, will be
seen from the continuation of his speech.</p>
<p class="quote">"The extension of this permission" (for publication of the debates)
"could only result from <em>inner</em> conviction, but not from <em>external</em>
influences."</p>
<p>
A surprising turn of phrase! The influence of the province on its Assembly
is characterised as something <em>external</em> to which the conviction of
the Assembly of the Estates is contrasted as a <em>delicate inner feeling</em>
whose highly sensitive nature calls out to the province: <em>Noli me tangere</em>!
<a href="#2" name="a2"><sup class="ednote">[B]</sup></a>
 This plaintive rhetoric about "<em>inner conviction</em>"
in contrast to the rude, external, unauthorised north wind of "public conviction"
is the more noteworthy since the purpose of the proposal was precisely
to make the inner conviction of the Assembly of the Estates external. Here
too, of course, there is an inconsistency. Where it seems to the speaker
more convenient, in <em>church</em> controversies, he appeals to the province.</p>
<p class="quote">"We," continues the speaker, "would let it" (publication) <em>"take
place</em> where <em>we</em> consider this expedient, and would <em>restrict</em>
it where an extension would appear to <em>us</em> purposeless or <em>even</em>
harmful."</p>
<p>
<em>We</em> will do what <em>we</em> like<em>. Sic volo, sic jubeo, stat pro
ratione voluntas</em>. <a href="#3" name="a3"><sup class="ednote">[C]</sup></a>
 It is truly the language of a ruler, which naturally has a pathetic flavour when coming from a modern baron.</p>
<p>Who are <em>we?</em> The <em>estates.</em> The publication of the
debates is intended for the province and not for the estates, but the speaker
teaches us to know better. Publication of the debates also is a <em>privilege</em>
of the Assembly of the Estates, which has the right, if it thinks fit,
to have its wisdom echoed by the many voices of the press.</p>
<p>The speaker knows only the province of the estates, not the estates
of the province. The Assembly of the Estates has a province to which the
privilege of its activity extends, but the province has no estates through
which it could itself be active. Of course, the province has the right,
under prescribed conditions, to create these gods for itself, but as soon
as they are created, it must, like a fetish worshipper, forget that these
gods are its own handiwork.</p>
<p>In this connection there is no telling, <em>inter alia</em>, why
a <em>monarchy without a Provincial Assembly</em> is not of more value than
a <em>monarchy with a Provincial Assembly,</em> for if the Assembly does
not represent the will of the province, we have more confidence in the
public intelligence of the government than in the private intelligence
of landed property.</p>
<p>We are confronted here with the peculiar spectacle, due perhaps
to the nature of the Provincial Assembly, of the province having to fight
not so much through its representatives as against them. According to the
speaker, the Assembly does not regard the general rights of the province
as the Assembly's only privileges, for in that case the daily unabridged
publication of the Assembly proceedings would be a new right of the Assembly,
because it would be a new right of the province; on the contrary, according
to the speaker, the province must regard the privileges of the Assembly
of the Estates as the province's only rights; and why not also the privileges
of some class of officials and of the nobility or the clergy!</p>
<p>Indeed, our speaker declares quite openly that the privileges
of the Assembly of the Estates decrease in proportion as the rights of
the province increase.</p>
<p class="quote">"Just as it seems to <em>him</em> desirable that here <em>in the Assembly</em>
there should be <em>freedom of discussion</em> and that an over-anxious weighing
of words should be avoided, it seems to him equally necessary, <em>in order
to maintain this freedom of expression and this frankness of speech</em>,
that <em>our words</em> at the time should be judged only by <em>those for
whom they are intended</em>."</p>
<p>
Precisely because freedom of discussion, the speaker concludes, is desirable
in our Assembly — and what freedoms would we not find desirable where
we are concerned? — precisely for that reason freedom of discussion is
not desirable in the province. Because it is desirable that we speak <em>frankly</em>,
it is still more desirable to keep the province in <em>thrall</em> to secrecy.
Our words are not <em>intended</em> for the province.</p>
<p>One must acknowledge the tact with which the speaker has perceived
that by unabridged publication of its debates the Assembly would become
a right of the province instead of a privilege of the Assembly of the Estates,
that the Assembly, having become an immediate object of the public spirit,
would have to decide to be a personification of the latter, and that, having
been put in the light of the general consciousness, it would have to renounce
its particular nature in favour of the general one.</p>
<p>But whereas the knightly speaker mistakenly regards personal privileges
and individual freedoms <em>vis-à-vis</em> the nation and the government
as general rights, and thereby unquestionably and pertinently expresses
the exclusive spirit of his <em>estate,</em> on the other hand he interprets
the spirit of the province in an absolutely wrong way by likewise transforming
its general demands into personal desires.</p>
<p>Thus the speaker seems to impute to the province a personally
passionate curiosity as regards <em>our words</em> (i.e., those of prominent
persons in the Assembly of the Estates).</p>
<p>We assure him that the province is by no means curious about "the
words" of the representatives of the estates as individuals, and only "such"
words can they rightly call "their" words. On the contrary, the province
demands that the words of the representatives of the estates should be
converted into the publicly audible voice of the country.</p>
<p>The question is whether the province should be <em>conscious of
being represented</em> or not! Should a new mystery of representation be
added to the mystery of government? In the government, too, the people
is represented. Hence a new representation of the people through the estates
is quite meaningless unless its specific character is precisely that in
this case matters are not dealt with on behalf of the province but, on
the contrary, the province itself deals with them; that the province is
not represented in it but rather represents itself. A representation which
is divorced from the consciousness of those whom it represents is no representation.
What I do not know, I do not worry about. It is a senseless contradiction
that the functioning of the state, which primarily expresses the <em>self-activity</em>
of the individual provinces, takes place without their <em>formal</em> co-operation,
without their joint <em>knowledge;</em> it is a senseless contradiction that
my self-activity should consist of acts unknown to me and done by another.</p>
<p>A publication of the Assembly proceedings that depends on the
arbitrary ruling of the Assembly of the Estates, however, is worse than
none at all, for if the Assembly tells me not what it is in reality, but
what it wants to seem to be in my eyes, I shall take it for what it gives
itself out to be, for mere semblance, and things are bad when semblance
has a legal existence.</p>
<p>Indeed, can even daily, unabridged publication <em>by printing</em>
be rightly called <em>unabridged</em> and <em>public</em>? Is there no abridgement
in substituting the written for the spoken word, graphic systems for persons,
action on paper for real action? Or does publicity consist only in a <em>real</em>
matter being reported to the public, and not rather in its being reported
to the <em>real public</em>, i.e., not to an imaginary reading public, but
to the living and actually present public?</p>
<p>Nothing is more contradictory than that the <em>highest public</em>
activity of the province is secret, that in private lawsuits the doors
of the court are open to the province, but that in its own lawsuit the
province has to remain outside.</p>
<p>In its true consistent meaning, therefore, unabridged publication
of the Assembly proceedings can only be <em>full publicity for the activity
of the Assembly.</em></p>
<p>Our speaker, however, proceeds to regard the Assembly as a kind
of club.</p>
<p class="quote">"From <em>many years' acquaintance</em>, a <em>good personal understanding</em>
has developed among most of us in spite of the most diverse views on various
matters, a relationship which is <em>inherited by newcomers</em>.</p>
<p class="quote">"Precisely for that reason we are most of all able to appreciate
the <em>value of our words</em>, and do so the more frankly as we allow ourselves
to be less subject to <em>external</em> influences, which could only be useful
if they came to us in the form of <em>well-meaning</em> counsel, but not
in the form of a <em>dogmatic judgment</em>, of praise or blame, seeking
to influence <em>our personality</em> through<em> public opinion</em>."</p>
<p>
The Herr Speaker appeals to our feelings.</p>
<p>We are so intimate together, we discuss things so openly, we weigh
the <em>value of our</em> words so exactly; are we to allow our attitude,
which is so patriarchal, so distinguished, so convenient, to be changed
by the judgment of the province, which perhaps attaches less value to our
words?</p>
<p>God help us! The Assembly cannot bear the light of day. We feel
more at ease in the darkness of private life. If the whole province has
sufficient confidence to entrust its rights to single individuals, it is
obvious that these individuals are condescending enough to accept the confidence
of the province, but it would be really extravagant to demand that they
should repay like for like and trustingly surrender themselves, their achievements,
their personalities, to the judgment of the province, which has already
pronounced a significant judgment on them. In any case, it is more important
that the personality of the representatives of the estates should not be
endangered by the province than that the interests of the province should
not be endangered by the representatives of the estates.</p>
<p>We want to be both fair and very gracious. It is true that we
— and we are a sort of government — permit no dogmatic judgment, no praise
or blame, no influence of public opinion on our <em>persona sacrosancta,</em>
but we do allow <em>well-meaning counsel</em>, not in the abstract sense
that it means well for the country, but in the fuller-sounding sense that
it expresses a passionate tenderness for the members of the estates, a
specially high opinion of their excellence.</p>
<p>True, one might think that if publicity is harmful to good understanding
among us, then the latter must be harmful to publicity. However this sophistry
forgets that the Provincial Assembly is the Assembly of the Estates and
not the Assembly of the Province. And who could resist the most convincing
of all arguments? If, in accordance with the constitution, the province
appoints estates to <em>represent its general intelligence</em>, it thereby
totally renounces <em>all its own judgment</em> and understanding, which
are now solely incorporated in the chosen representatives. just as the
legend has it that great inventors were put to death or, what is no legend,
that they were buried alive in fortresses as soon as they had imparted
their secret to the ruler, so the political reason of the province always
falls on its own sword as soon as it has made its great invention of the
Assembly, but of course to rise again like the phoenix for the next elections.
</p>
<p>After these obtrusively emotional descriptions of the dangers
threatening the personalities of the estates from outside, i.e., from the
province, through publication of the proceedings, the speaker closes this
diatribe with the guiding thought that we have traced through his speech
up to now.</p>
<p class="quote">"<em>Parliamentary freedom</em>," a very fine-sounding expression, "is
in its first period of development. It must gain by <em>protection</em> and
<em>care</em> that <em>internal</em> force and <em>independence</em> which are
absolutely necessary before it can be exposed without detriment to <em>external</em>
storms."</p>
<p>
Once again the old fatal antithesis of the Assembly as something <em>internal</em>
and the province as something <em>external</em>.</p>
<p>In any case, we have long been of the opinion that <em>parliamentary
freedom</em> is at the beginning of its beginning, and the above speech
has convinced us afresh that the <em>primitiae studiorum</em> in <em>politicis</em>
<a href="#4" name="a4"><sup class="ednote">[D]</sup></a>
 have still not been completed. But by that
we by no means imply — and the above speech once again confirms our opinion
— that the Assembly should be given a still longer time in which to continue
its independent ossification in <em>opposition</em> to the province. Perhaps
by <em>parliamentary freedom</em> the speaker understands the freedom of
the <em>old French</em> parliaments. According to his own admission, a many
years' acquaintance prevails among the Assembly of the Estates, its spirit
is even transmitted as a <em>hereditary disease </em>to the <em>homines novi</em>,
yet the time has still not come for publicity? The Twelfth Assembly may
give the same reply as the Sixth, only with the more emphatic expression
that it is too independent to allow itself to be deprived of the <em>aristocratic
privilege of secret proceedings.</em></p>
<p>Of course, the development of <em>parliamentary</em> freedom in
the old French sense, independence from public opinion, and the stagnation
of the caste spirit, advance most thoroughly through isolation, but to
warn against precisely this development cannot be premature. A truly political
assembly flourishes only under the great protection of the <em>public spirit</em>,
just as living things flourish only in the <em>open air</em>. Only "exotic"
plants, which have been transferred to a climate that is foreign to them,
require the protection and care of a <em>greenhouse</em>. Does the speaker
regard the Assembly as an "exotic" plant in the free, serene climate of
the Rhine Province?</p>
<p>In view of the fact that our speaker from the knightly estate
expounded with almost comic seriousness, with almost melancholy dignity
and almost religious pathos, the thesis of the <em>lofty wisdom</em> of the
Assembly of the Estates, as also of its medieval <em>freedom</em> and <em>independence</em>,
the uninitiated will be surprised to see him sink in the question of the
<em>freedom of the press</em> from the lofty wisdom of the <em>Provincial
Assembly</em> to the general <em>lack of wisdom of the human race</em>, from
the independence and freedom of the privileged social estates he had extolled
only just before to the <em>fundamental lack of freedom and independence
of human nature</em>. We are not surprised to encounter here one of the
present-day numerous champions of the Christian-knightly, modern feudal
principle, in short the romantic principle.</p>
<p>These gentlemen, because they want to regard freedom not as the
natural gift of the universal sunlight of reason, but as the supernatural
gift of a specially favourable constellation of the stars, because they
regard freedom as merely an <em>individual property</em> of certain persons
and social estates, are in consequence compelled to include universal reason
and universal freedom among the <em>bad ideas</em> and phantoms of <em>"logically
constructed systems". </em>In order to save the special freedoms of privilege,
they proscribe the universal freedom of human nature. Since, however, the
bad brood of the nineteenth century, and the very consciousness of the
modern knights that has been infected by this century, cannot comprehend
what is in itself incomprehensible, because devoid of idea, namely, how
internal, essential, universal determinations prove to be linked with certain
human individuals by external, fortuitous, particular features, without
being connected with the human essence, with reason in general, and therefore
common to all individuals — because of this they necessarily have recourse
to the <em>miraculous</em> and the <em>mystical</em>. Further, because the
<em>real</em> position of these gentlemen in the modern state does not at
all correspond to the notion they have of that position, because they live
in a world <em>beyond the real one</em>, and because therefore <em>imagination</em>
is their head and heart, being dissatisfied with their practical activity,
they necessarily have recourse to theory, but to the <em>theory of the other
world</em>, to <em>religion</em>, which in their hands, however, is given
a polemical bitterness impregnated with political tendencies and becomes
more or less consciously only a holy cloak for very secular, but at the
same time fantastic desires.</p>
<p>Thus we shall find that to practical demands our speaker counterposes
a mystical religious theory of the imagination, to real theories — a pettily
clever, pragmatically cunning wisdom of experience drawn from the most
superficial practice, to the human understanding-superhuman holiness, and
to the real holiness of ideas-the arbitrariness and disbelief characterising
a base point of view. The more aristocratic, more nonchalant, and therefore
more sober, language of the speaker from the princely estate is superseded
here by emotional affectation and fantastically extravagant unction, which
previously withdrew much more into the background before the feeling of
privilege.</p>
<p class="quote">"The less it is possible to deny that the press nowadays is a political
power, the more erroneous seems to him the equally widespread view that
truth and light will emerge from <em>the struggle between the good and the
bad press</em> and can be expected to become more widely and effectively
disseminated. <em>Man, individually and in the mass, is always one and the
same. He is by his nature imperfect</em> and <em>immature</em> and needs <em>education</em>
as long as his <em>development</em> continues, and it ceases only with his
<em>death</em>. The art of education, however, does not consist in punishing
prohibited actions, but in furthering good influences and keeping away
evil ones. It is, however, inseparable from this <em>human imperfection</em>
that the <em>siren song of evil</em> has a powerful effect on the masses
and opposes the simple and sober voice of truth as an obstacle which, even
if not absolute, is in any case difficult to overcome. The <em>bad</em> press
appeals only to men's passions; no means are too bad for it when it is
a question of attaining its <em>aim</em> by arousing passions — that aim
being the <em>greatest possible dissemination</em> of <em>bad principles</em>
and the <em>greatest possible furtherance of bad frames of mind</em>; it
has at its disposal all the advantages of that most dangerous of all <em>offensives,</em>
for which there are objectively no restrictions of right and subjectively
no laws of morality or even of external decency. On the other hand, the
<em>good press</em> is <em>always confined</em> to the <em>defensive. </em>For
the most part its effect can only be that of <em>defending, restraining
and consolidating</em>, without being able to boast of any significant progress
in enemy territory. It is good fortune enough if external obstacles do
not render this still more difficult".</p>
<p>
We have given this passage in full in order not to weaken its possible
emotional impression on the reader.</p>
<p>The speaker has put himself <em>à la hauteur des principes.</em> <a href="#5" name="a5"><sup class="ednote">[E]</sup></a> In order to combat <em>freedom of the
press,</em> the thesis of the <em>permanent immaturity</em> of the human race
has to be defended. It is sheer tautology to assert that if absence of
freedom is men's essence, freedom is contrary to his essence. Malicious
sceptics could be daring enough not to take the speaker at his word.</p>
<p>If the immaturity of the human race is the mystical ground for
opposing freedom of the press, then the censorship at any rate is a highly
reasonable means against the maturity of the human race.</p>
<p>What undergoes development is imperfect. Development ends only
with death. Hence it would be truly consistent to kill man in order to
free him from this state of imperfection. That at least is what the speaker
concludes in order to kill freedom of the press. In his view, true education
consists in keeping a person wrapped up in a cradle throughout his life,
for as soon as he learns to walk, he learns also to fall, and only by falling
does he learn to walk. But if we all remain in swaddling-clothes, who is
to wrap us in them? If we all remain in the cradle, who is to rock us?
If we are all prisoners, who is to be prison warder?</p>
<p>Man, individually and in the mass, is imperfect by nature. <em>De
principiis non est disputandum.</em> <a href="#6" name="a6"><sup class="ednote">[F]</sup></a> 
Granted! What follows from that? The arguments of our speaker are imperfect,
governments are imperfect, assemblies are imperfect, freedom of the press
is imperfect, every sphere of human existence is imperfect. Hence if one
of these spheres ought not to exist because of this imperfection, none
of them has the right to exist, man in general has no right to exist.</p>
<p>Given man's fundamental imperfection — let us assume it is true
— then we know in advance that all human institutions are imperfect. There
is no need to touch on that further, it does not speak for them or against
them, it is not their <em>specific character</em>, it is not their distinctive
mark.</p>
<p>Amid all these imperfections, why should precisely the free press
be perfect? Why does an imperfect provincial estate demand a perfect press?</p>
<p>The imperfect requires education. Is not education also human
and therefore imperfect? Does not education itself also require education?</p>
<p>If then, by <em>its very existence,</em> everything human is imperfect,
ought we therefore to lump everything together, have the same respect for
everything, good and evil, truth and falsehood? The true conclusion must
be that as in looking at a picture I have to leave the spot from which
I see only blots of colour but not colours, irregularly intersecting lines
but not a drawing, similarly I must abandon the point of view which shows
me the world and human relations only in their most external appearance,
and recognise that this point of view is unsuitable for judging the value
of things; for how could I judge, distinguish things, from a point of view
which admits only the one flat idea about the whole universe that everything
in it is imperfect? This point of view itself is the most imperfect of
all the imperfections it sees around it. We must therefore take the essence
of the inner idea as the measure to evaluate the existence of things. Then
we shall less allow ourselves to be led astray by a one-sided and trivial
experience, since in such cases the result is indeed that all experience
ceases, all judgment is abolished, all cows are black.</p>
