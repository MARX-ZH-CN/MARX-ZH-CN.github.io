Dear Friend,
 <p>I take the liberty of sending you a small contribution for the <em>Deutsche Jahrbücher</em> in the form of the enclosed criticism of the censorship instruction.
 <p> If the article is suitable for your journal, I ask you for the time being not to mention <em>my name to anyone except Wigand</em>, and also to Send me <em>by post immediately</em> the issues of the <em>Deutsche Jahrbücher</em> containing my article; because <em>for the time being</em> here in Trier I am completely excluded from the literary world.
 <p> It is obvious that it is in the interest of the cause that the printing should be expedited, if the censorship does not censor my censure.
<p>
  If you do not know of a critic for Vatke's super-clever book on sin - were it not so devilishly clever, one would be tempted to call it stupid--my critical zeal is at your disposal.
<p>
 It would perhaps be equally worth while to deal again with Bayer's work on the moral Spirit. Feuerbach's criticism was a friendly service. Honourable as is Bayer's moral frame of mind, his work itself is just as weak and even immoral.
<p>
  I should be very glad if you would let <em>Wigand</em> know that my manuscript will reach you in a few days' time. <em>Bauer's</em> letter in
which he demands that it should be sent off <em>at last</em>, came when I was very ill in bed and therefore was handed to me only a few days ago. Being busy on the enclosed article, I was not able to make the necessary corrections.
 <p>As I have now come to the end of some voluminous works, it goes without saying that all my forces are at the disposal of the <em>Deutsche Jahrbücher</em>.
<p>
With sincere respect,<p>
           Marx
<p>
 My address is: Dr. Marx, Trier, to be delivered to Geheimer Regierungsrat von Westphalen.
