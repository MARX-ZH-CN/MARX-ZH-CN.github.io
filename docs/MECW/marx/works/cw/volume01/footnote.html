<h3>Editors’ Footnotes from Volume 1</h3>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">1</span><a name="1"></a> <em>Reflections of a Young Man on the Choice of a Profession</em> — an essay written by Marx at the school leaving examinations at the Royal Frederick William III gymnasium in Trier in August 1835. Only seven of Marx’s examination papers have been preserved: the above-mentioned essay on a subject at the writer’s choice, a Latin essay on the reign of Augustus and a religious essay (both are published in the appendices to this volume), a Latin unseen, a translation from the Greek, a translation into French, and a paper in mathematics (all of which are published in: Marx/Engels, <em>Historisch-Kritische </em>Gesamtausgabe, Erste Abteilung, Band 1, Zweiter Halbband, Berlin, 1929, S. 164-82).</p>
<p>In the original there are numerous underscorings presumably made by the history and philosophy teacher, the then headmaster of the gymnasium, Johann Hugo Wyttenbach (they are not reproduced in the present edition). He also made the following comment: “Rather good. The essay is marked by a wealth of thought and a good systematised narration. But generally the author here too made a mistake ‘ peculiar to him-he constantly seeks for elaborate picturesque expressions. Therefore many passages which are underlined lack the necessary clarity and definiteness and often precision in separate expressions as well as in whole paragraphs.”</p>
<p>In English this essay was published in 1961 in the United States, in the journal <em>The New </em>Scholasticism, Vol. XXXV, No. 2, Baltimore-Washington, pp. 197-20 1, and in Writings <em>of the </em>Young Marx on Philosophy and <em>Society, </em>New York, 1967, pp. 35-39. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">2</span><a name="2"></a> <em>Letter from Marx to His Father — </em>this is the only letter written by Marx in his student years which has been preserved. Of all Marx’s letters that are extant, this is the earliest. It was published in English in the collections: The Young Marx, London, 1967, pp. 135-47, <em>Writings of the Young Marx on Philosophy and Society, </em>New York, 1967, pp. 40-50 and Karl Marx. Early Texts, translated and edited by David McLellan, University of Kent at Canterbury, Oxford, 1971, pp. 1-10. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">3</span><a name="3"></a> The Pandect-compendium of Roman civil law (<em>Corpus iurus civilis</em>) made by order of the Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire Justinian 1 in 528-534. The Pandect or the Digest contained excerpts from works in civil and criminal law by prominent Roman jurists. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">4</span><a name="4"></a> The work mentioned is not extant. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">5</span><a name="5"></a>  Marx quotes these passages from memory. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">6</span><a name="6"></a> This refers to the classification of contracts in Immanuel Kant’s <em>Die Metaphysik der Sitten. </em>Theil I.<em> Metaphysische Anfangsgr nde der Rechtslehre, K nigsberg</em>, 1797-98. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">7</span><a name="7"></a> The philosophical dialogue mentioned here has not been preserved.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">8</span><a name="8"></a> The <em>Doctors’ Club</em> was founded by representatives of the radical wing of the Hegelian school in Berlin in 1837. Among its members were lecturer on theology of Berlin University Bruno Bauer, gymnasium history teacher Karl Friedrich K ppen and geography teacher Adolf Rutenberg. The usual meeting place was the small Hippel caf . The Club, of which Marx was also an active member, played an important part in the Young Hegelian movement. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">9</span><a name="9"></a> The work has not been preserved. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">10</span><a name="10"></a> Marx refers to the <em>Deutscher Musenalmanach</em>, a liberal annual published in Leipzig from 1829.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">11</span><a name="11"></a> As is seen from Heinrich Marx’s letter of September 16, 1837, to his son (see this volume, p. 680), Karl Marx intended at that time to publish a journal of theatrical criticism. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">12</span><a name="12"></a> The letter has not survived.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">13</span><a name="13"></a> These two poems, written in 1837, were included in a book of verse dedicated to Karl Marx’s father (see this volume, pp. 531-632). The general title Wild Songs was introduced when the poems were published in the journal Athendum in 1841. The text of both poems was reproduced with slight alterations. In 71e Fiddler two lines</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Fort aus dem Haus, fort aus dem Blick, Willst Kindlein spielen urn dein Genick?” (“Away from the house, away from the look, 0 child, do you seek to risk your neck?")</p>
<p class="fst">coming in the original in the fifth stanza after the lines</p>
<p class="quoteb">“How so! I plunge, plunge without fail<br>
My blood-black sabre into your soul”</p>
<p class="fst">were omitted.</p>
<p>A comment on the Wild Songs was published in the Frankfurter <em>Konversationsblatt</em> No. 62 of March 3, 1841. Though unfavourably commenting on the form, the paper admitted the author’s “original talent”.</p>
<p>In English the poems were published in the book: R. Payne, Marx, New York, 1968, pp. 62-64.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="14"></a>
<span class="term">14.</span> Marx’s work <em><a href="../../1841/dr-theses/index.html" target=_blank>Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature</a></em> is part of a general research on the history of ancient philosophy which he planned as far back as 1839.</p>
<p>
During his research on ancient philosophy Marx compiled the preparatory <em>Notebooks on Epicurean Philosophy </em>(see this volume, pp. 401-509).  In early April 1841 Marx submitted his work to the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Jena as a dissertation for a doctor’s degree (see this volume, p. 379) and received the degree on April 15.  He intended to have his work printed and for this purpose wrote the dedication and the foreword dated March 1841.  However, he did not succeed in getting it published, although he thought of doing so again at the end of 1841 and beginning of 1842.</p>
<p>
Marx’s own manuscript of the thesis has been lost.  What remains is an incomplete copy written by an unknown person.  This copy has corrections and insertions in Marx’s handwriting.  Texts of the fourth and fifth chapters of Part One and the Appendix, except for one fragment, are missing.  Each chapter of Part One and Part Two has its own numeration of the author’s notes.  These notes, in the form of citations from the sources and additional commentaries, are also incomplete.  They are given, according to the copy of the manuscript which has survived, after the main text of the dissertation and marked in the text, in distinction to the editorial notes, by numbers and brackets.  Obvious slips of the pen have been corrected.  Changes made by Marx which affect the meaning are specified.</p>
<p>
In the first publication of the thesis in <em>Aus dem Literischen Nachlass</em>" <em>von Kar1 Marx, Friedrich Engels und Ferdinand Lassalle</em>, Bd.  I, Stuttgart, 1902, the fragments from the Appendix "<em>Critique of Plutarch’s Polemic Against the Theology of Epicurus</em>", have been omitted as well as all the author’s notes except for some excerpts.  The first publication in full (according to the part of the manuscript that has been preserved) was carried out by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, CC CPSU, in 1927 in Volume One of MEGA (Marx/Engels, <em>Historisch-Kritische Gesamtausgabe, Erste Abteilung</em>, Band 1, Erster Halbband, S. 3-81).</p>
<p>
The first translation into English was done by the Austrian-born Kurt Karl Merz in 1946 in Melbourne (a typewritten copy of it is kept in the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, CC CPSU, in Moscow).  The foreword to the thesis was published in the collection: K. Marx and F. Engels, <em>On Religion</em> Moscow, 1957, pp. 13-15.  In 1967 a translation by Norman D. Livergood was published in the book: <em>Activity in Marx’s Philosophy, </em>Hague, 1967, pp. 55-109.  Two excerpts from the dissertation (see this volume, pp. 84-87 and 103-05) were published in <em>Writings of the Young Marx on Philosophy and Society</em>, New York, 1967, pp. 60-66, and Kari Marx.  Early Texts, Oxford, 1971, pp. 11-22.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="15"></a>
<span class="term">15</span> Marx here refers to the book Petri Gassendi, <em>Animadversiones in decimum librum Diogenis Laertii, qui est De Vita, Moribus, Placitisque Epicuri</em>, Ludguni, 1649.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="16"></a>
<span class="term">16</span> Marx never realised his plan to write a larger work on the Epicurean, Stoic and Sceptic philosophies.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="17"></a>
<span class="term">17</span> This refers to the following passage from the book by Karl Friedrich K ppen, <em>Friedrich der Grosse und seine Widersacher</em>, Leipzig, 1840: "<em>Epikureismus, Stoikismus und Skepsis und die Nervenmuskel und Eingeweidesysteme des antiken Organismus, deren unmittelbare, nat rliche Einheit die Sch nheit und Sittlichkeit des Altertums bedingte, und die beim Absterben desselben auseinanderfielen</em>" (S. 39) ("Epicureanism, Stoicism and Scepticism are the nerve muscles and intestinal system of the antique organism whose immediate, natural unity conditioned the beauty and morality of antiquity, and which disintegrated with the decay of the latter").  K ppen dedicated his book to Karl Marx.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="18"></a>
<span class="term">18</span>. Marx quotes David Hume’s <em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em> from the German translation: <em>David Hume  ber die menschliche Natur aus Englischen nebst kritischen Versuchen zur Beurtheilung dieses Werks von Ludwig Heinrich Jakob</em>, 1. Bd., <em> ber den menschlichen Verstand</em>, Halle, 1790, S. 485.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="19"></a>
<span class="term">19</span> Marx quotes from a letter by Epicurus to Menoeceus; see <em>Diogenes Laertii de clarorum philosophorum vitis, dogmatibus et apophthegmatibus libri decem </em>(X, 123).</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="20"></a>
<span class="term">20</span> Gymnosophists - Greek name for Indian sages.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="21"></a>
<span class="term">21</span> Ataraxy- in ancient Greek ethics- tranquillity.  In Epicurean ethics - the ideal of life; state of the sage who has attained inner freedom through knowledge of nature and deliverance from fear of death.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="22"></a>
<span class="term">22</span> The manuscripts of "General Difference in principle Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature" and "Result" have not been found.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="23"></a>
<span class="term">23</span> Characterising here the gods of Epicurus, Marx, obviously, had in mind the remark by Johann Joachim Winckelmann in his book <em>Geschichte der Kunst des Altelluim</em>, 2 Teile, Dresden, 1767: "The beauty of the deities in their virile age consists in the combination of the strength of mature years and the joyfulness of youth, and this consists here in the lack of nerves and sinews, which are less apparent in the flowering of the years.  But in this lies also an expression of divine self-containment which is not in need of the parts of our body which serve for its nourishment; and this illuminates Epicurus’ opinion concerning the shape of the gods to which he gives a body, which looks like a body, and blood, but which looks like blood, something which Cicero considers obscure and inconceivable".</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="24"></a>
<span class="term">24</span> Hyrcanian Sea-ancient name of the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="25"></a>
<span class="term">25</span> The reference is probably to the commentaries by johann Baptist Carl Niirnberger and johann Gottlob Schncider on the following editions: Diogems <em>Laertius.  De vitis, dogmatibus et aethegmatibus liber decimus graece et latine separation editus</em>... a Carolo N rnbergerg Norimbergae, 1791 (the second edition appeared in 1808) and <em>Epicuri physica et meteorologica duabus epistolis eiusdem compmhenia.  Graeca ad fidem librorum sciiptorum et editorum emandavit atque interpretatus est</em>. jo.  Gottl. Schneider, Lipsiae, 1813.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="26"></a>
<span class="term">26</span> This is not Metrodorus of Lampsacus, the disciple of Epicurus, but Metrodorus of Chios, the disciple of Democritus, named incorrectly by Stobaeus (in the author’s note) as the teacher of Epicurus.  The same lines may be found in the fifth notebook on Epicurean philosophy (see this volume, pp. 96 and 486).</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="27"></a>
<span class="term">27</span> Two fragments from the Appendix have been preserved: the beginning of the first paragraph of Section Two and the author’s notes to Section One.  The general title of the Appendix, which is missing in the first fragment, is reproduced here according to the contents (see this volume, p. 33).  The text of this fragment corresponds almost word for word to the text of the third notebook on Epicurean philosophy (see this volume, pp. 452-54) and was written in an unknown hand on paper of the same kind as the text of the notebook.  On this ground some scholars assume that this fragment does not belong to the Doctoral dissertation, but is part of a non-extant work on ancient philosophy.  The content of the fragment, however, and the quotations from Plutarch in it are closely connected with the author’s notes to the Appendix (see this volume, pp. 102-05).  As the available data do not yet permit a final decision as to where this fragment belongs, in this edition it is included in the Doctoral dissertation.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="28"></a>
<span class="term">28</span> The reference is to Plutarch’s mystic conception of three eternally existing categories of men. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="29"></a>
<span class="term">29</span> In the manuscript of the author’s notes all quotations are given in the original-Greek or Latin.  While Marx, in the <em>Notebooks </em>on Epicurean Philosophy, quotes Diogenes Laertius according to Pierre Gassendi’s edition (Lyons, 1649), in his notes to the dissertation he quotes from the Tauchnitz edition of Diogenes Laertius, <em>De vitis philosorum libri</em>.... X, T. 1-2, Lipsiae, 1833. Editorial explanatory insertions are given in square brackets when necessary.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="30"></a>
<span class="term">30</span> Massilians were the citizens of the city of Massilia, now Marseilles, founded circa 600 B. C. as a Greek colony by Ionic Phocaeans. The battle of Marius with the German Cimbri tribes who invaded Caul and Northern Italy took place in 101 B. C. near Vercelli. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="31"></a>
<span class="term">31</span> Marx refers here to the struggle between different trends in the German philosophy of the late thirties and early forties of the nineteenth century. By the "liberal party" Marx means here the Young Hegelians.  The most advanced of the Young Hegelians (Ludwig Feuerbach, Bruno Bauer, Arnold Ruge) took the stand of atheism and political radicalism.  In answer to this evolution of the Left wing of the Hegelian school, the conservative German philosophers united under the banner of the so-called positive philosophy- a religious-mystical trend (Christian Hermann Weisse, Immanuel Hermann Fichte junior, Franz Xaver von Baader, Anton Gunther and others), which criticised Hegel’s philosophy from the right.  The "positive philosophers" tried to make philosophy subservient to religion by proclaiming divine revelation the only source of "positive" knowledge.  They called negative every philosophy which recognised rational cognition as its source.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="32"></a>
<span class="term">32</span> Marx cites (in the manuscript in French) from the book <em>System de La nature, ou des du monde physique et du monde moral.  Par.  M. Mirabaud, Secr taire Perp tuel et 1’un des Quarante de l’Acad mie Francaise</em>, Londres, 1770.  The real author of the book was the French philosopher Paul Holbach, who for the sake of secrecy put the name of J. Mirabaud, the secretary of the French Academy, on his book (J. Mirabaud died in 1760).</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="33"></a>
<span class="term">33</span> Both Friedrich Schelling’s works quoted by Marx (<em>Philosophische Briefe uber Dogmatismus und Kriticismus and Vom Ich als Princip der Philosophie, oder uber das Unbedingte im menschlichen Wissen</em>) appeared in 1795.  Later Schelling renounced his progressive views and turned to religious mysticism.  In 1841 Schelling was invited by the Prussian authorities to the University of Berlin to oppose the influence of the representatives of the Hegelian school, the Young Hegelians in particular.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="34"></a>
<span class="term">34</span> Marx probably refers to the 13th lecture on the history of religion delivered by Hegel at the University of Berlin during the summer term of 1829.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="35"></a>
<span class="term">35</span> The reference is to Kant’s critique of different ways of proving God’s existence in his <em>Kritik der reinen Vernunft</em> (Critique of Pure Reason).</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="36"></a>
<span class="term">36</span> Marx refers to the following remark made by Kant in his Critique of Pure Reason in connection with the speculation on the logical meaning of the elements of reasoning (subject, predicate and the copula "is"): "... A hundred real talers do not contain the least coin more than a hundred possible talers.  For as the latter signify the concept, and the former the object and the positing of the object, should the former contain more than the latter, my concept would not, in that case, express the whole object, and would not therefore be an adequate concept of it.  My financial position is, however, affected very differently by a hundred real talers than it is by the mere concept of them (that is, of their possibility).  For the object, as it actually exists, is not analytically contained in my concept, but is added to my concept (which is a determination of my state) synthetically; and yet the conceived hundred talers are not themselves in the least increased through thus acquiring existence outside my concept."</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="37"></a>
<span class="term">37</span> <em>Wends</em> — old name of West Slavic tribes.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="38"></a>
<span class="term">38</span> At the end of 1841 and beginning of 1842 Marx made a new attempt to publish his dissertation.  He drafted the beginning of a new preface in which many passages were altered or crossed out.  It was probably at the same period that he wrote the note against Schelling which was inserted in Marx’s handwriting in the copy of the manuscript.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">39</span><a name="39"></a> <em>Comments on the Latest Prussian Censorship Instruction</em> was the first work written by Marx as a revolutionary journalist. It was occasioned by the censorship instruction of the Prussian Government of December 24, 1841. Though formulated in moderate liberal terms, the instruction actually not only retained but intensified the censorship of the press. Written between January 15 and February 10, 1842, just after the publication of the instruction in the press (it was published in the <em>Allgemeine Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em> No. 14, January 14, 1842; Marx cites from this publication), the article was originally intended for the <em>Deutsche Jahrb cher</em> under the editorship of Arnold Ruge (see this volume, p. 381) but because of the censorship restrictions it was published only in 1843 in Switzerland in Anekdota which contained works by appositional authors, mostly Young Hegelians.</p>
<p>Excerpts from the article were reprinted in the <em>Mannheimer Abendzeitung</em> Nos. 71 and 72, March 26 and 28, 1843.</p>
<p>In 1851 Hermann Becker, a member of the Communist League, made an attempt to publish Marx’s collected works in Cologne. On the author’s initiative the first issue began with this article (<em>see Gesammette Aufs tze von Karl Marx, herausgegeben von Hermann Becker</em>, 1. Heft, K ln, 1851). However, the publication was ceased because of the government repressions.</p>
<p>The first English translation of the article appeared in <em>Writings</em> <em>of the </em>Young <em>Marx on Philosophy and Society</em>, New York, 1967, pp. 67-92, and an excerpt from it in <em>Karl Marx. Early Texts</em>, Oxford, 1971, pp. 26-30. P. 109</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">40</span><a name="40"></a> The reference is to the <em>Bundesakte</em> adopted by the Congress of Vienna on June 8, 1815. The Act proclaimed the formation of a German Confederation consisting initially of 34 independent states and four free cities. The Act virtually sanctioned the political dismemberment of Germany and the maintaining of the monarchical estate system in the German states.</p>
<p>Article 18 of the Act vaguely mentioned a forthcoming drafting of uniform instructions providing for “freedom of the press” in the states of the German Confederation. However, this article remained on paper. The Provisional Federal Act on the Press of September 20, 1819 (it remained provisional for ever), introduced preliminary censorship for all publications of not more than 20 signatures (actually all periodicals) throughout Germany as well as a series of other restrictions. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">41</span><a name="41"></a> <em>Lettre de cachet</em> — <em>a </em>secret royal order for the imprisonment or exile of any person without judge or jury. This method of reprisals against appositional elements and undesirable persons was widely used in France in the period of absolutism, especially under Louis XIV and Louis XV.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">42</span><a name="42"></a> An allusion to the negotiations of Prussian diplomats with the Pope concerning the disagreements between the Prussian Government and the Catholic Church known as the “Cologne” or “church conflict”. The conflict concerning the religious denomination of children of mixed marriages between Catholics and Protestants arose in 1837 with the arrest of C. A. Droste-Vischering, Archbishop of Cologne, who was accused of high treason for refusing to obey the orders of Frederick William Ill, the King of Prussia. It ended in 1841 under Frederick William IV with the Prussian Government yielding to the Catholic Church (see Marx’s letter to Ruge of July 9, 1842, pp. 389-90 of this volume). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">43</span><a name="43"></a> The article Proceedings of the Sixth Rhine Province Assembly. First Article. Debates on Freedom of the Press and Publication of the Proceedings<em> of the Assembly of the Estates </em>was Marx’s first contribution to <em>the Rheinische Zeitung f r Politik, Handel und Gewerbe</em>. Marx began his work as a contributor and in October 1842 became one of the editors of the newspaper. By its content and approach to vital political problems, the article helped the newspaper, founded by the appositional Rhenish bourgeoisie as a liberal organ, to begin a transition to the revolutionary-democratic positions.</p>
<p>The appearance of Marx’s article in the press raised a favourable response in progressive circles. Georg Jung, manager of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>, wrote to Marx: “Your articles on freedom of the press are extremely good.... Meyen wrote that the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> had eclipsed the <em>Deutsche Jahrb cher</em> ... that in Berlin everybody was overjoyed with it” (MEGA, Abt. 1, Bd. 1, Hb. 2, S. 275). In his comments on the article published in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> Arnold Ruge wrote: “Nothing more profound and more substantial has been said or could have been said on freedom of the press and in defence of it” <em>(Deutsche Jahb cher</em>, 1842, S. 535-36).</p>
<p>In the early 1850s Marx included this article in his collected works then being prepared for publication by Hermann Becker (see Note 39). However only the beginning of the article was included in the first issue. The major part of the text which had been published in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 139 was left unprinted. The end of the article was intended for the following issue, which was never published.</p>
<p>A copy of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> which Marx sent from London to Becker in Cologne in February 1851 with the author’s notes on the text of the articles (mostly in the form of abbreviations) intended for the edition Becker was preparing has recently been found in the archives of Cologne University library. This copy of the newspaper proves that Marx thought of publishing-partly in an abridged form- many of his articles written for the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>. However, his plan was not realised. Marginal notes show that the articles “Communal Reform and the <em>K lnische Zeitung</em>” and “A Correspondent of the <em>K lnische Zeitung</em> vs. the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> belong to Marx. These articles have never been published in any collection of Marx’s works.</p>
<p>In English an excerpt from the Proceedings was published in <em>Karl Marx. Early Texts</em>, Oxford, 1971, pp. 35-36.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">44</span><a name="44"></a> Marx devoted three articles to the debates of the Sixth Rhine Province Assembly, only two of which, the first and the third, were published. In the first article Marx proceeded with his criticism of the Prussian censorship which he had begun in his as yet unpublished article “Comments on the Latest Prussian Censorship Instruction”. The second article, devoted to the conflict between the Prussian Government and the Catholic Church, was banned by the censors. The manuscript of this article has not survived, but the general outline of it is given by Marx in his letter to Ruge of July 9, 1842 (see this volume, pp. 389-90). The third article is devoted to the debates of the Rhine Province Assembly on the law on wood thefts. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">45</span><a name="45"></a> <em>Assemblies of the estates </em>were introduced in Prussia in 1823. They embraced the heads of princely families, representatives of the knightly estate, i.e., the nobility, of towns and rural communities. The election system based on the principle of landownership provided for a majority of the nobility in the assemblies. The competency of the assemblies was restricted to questions of local economy and administration. They also had the right to express their desires on government bills submitted for discussion.</p>
<p class="fst">The Sixth Rhine Province Assembly was in session from May 23 to July 25, 1841, in D sseldorf. Ale debates dealt with in the article took place during the discussion on publication of the proceedings of the assemblies (this right had been granted by the Royal edict of April 30, 1841) and in connection with petitions of a number of towns on freedom of the press.</p>
<p class="fst">Citations in the text are given according to the <em>Sitzungs-Protokolle</em> <em>des sechsten Rheinischen Provinziat-Landtags</em>, Koblenz, 1841. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">46</span><a name="46"></a> The reference is to the article “<em>Die inlandische Presse u. die inlandische Statistik</em>”, published in the <em>Allgemeine Preussische Staats-Zeitung</em> No. 86, March 26,1842. Marx cited mainly from this article, and also from two other articles<em>, “Die Wirkung der Zensur-Verfiigung vom 24. Dezember 1841</em>” <em>and “Die Besprechung inlandscher Angelegenheiten</em>,” published in the same newspaper in Nos. 75 and 78, March 16 and 19, 1842, respectively.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">47</span><a name="47"></a> <em>Vossische Zeitung</em> — the name given after its owner to the daily <em>K niglich privilegirte Berlinische Zeitung von Staats und gelehnen Sachen.</em> </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">48</span><a name="48"></a> <em>Spenerche Zeitung</em> -the name given after its publisher to the <em>Berlinische Nachrichten von Staats- und gelehrten Sachen</em> which was a semiofficial government organ at the beginning of the 1840s. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">49</span><a name="49"></a> Marx ironically compares Prussian officialdom’s enthusiasm for statistics with the ardent philosophical systems which assigned a special importance to signs and numbers. He hints in particular at the ardent Chinese “I Ching” writings, of which Confucius was considered in the nineteenth century to be one of the first commentators. According to the philosophical conception laid down in them, hu signs, which were formed from variou-s combinations of three continuous or broken lines, symbolised things and natural phenomena.</p>
<p>When calling Pythagoras the “universal statistician” Marx had in mind the ancient Greek philosophers’ conceptions of number as the essence of all things. </p>

Its representatives (Gustav Hugo and Friedrich Carl von Savigny) tried to justify the privileges enjoyed by the nobility and the existence of feudal institutions by eternal historical traditions. An assessment of this school is given by Marx in the article “The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law” (ace this volume, pp. 203-10). </p>

Its name was changed and publication transferred from the Prussian town of Halle to Saxony because of the threat of suppression in the Prussian state. However, it did not last long under its new name.

<p><em>Young Germany</em> — a group of writers which emerged in the 1830s in Germany and was influenced by Heinrich Heine and Ludwig Bisme. The Young Germany writers (Karl Gutzkow, Ludolf Wienbarg, Theodor Mundt and others) came out in defence of freedom of conscience and the press, their writings, fiction and journalists, reflecting opposition sentiments of the petty-bourgeoisie and intellectuals.

Attacking the leader of the Young Hegelians in his pamphlet <em>Bruno Bauer und die akademische Lehrfreiheit</em>, Gruppe tried under the guise of non-partisanship and neutrality in philosophy to discredit Bauer as a critic of the gospel sources. In his article Marx cites and slightly paraphrases Gruppe’s statement: “The writer of these lines has never served any party and has not been influenced by anybody.” The Young Hegelian journal <em>Deutsche Jahrb cher</em> replied with a series of articles in defence of Bruno Bauer. </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">80</span><a name="80"></a> The reference is to the tenth congress of scientists of France which took-place in Strasbourg from September 28 to October 9, 1842. It was attended by scientists from Germany, Switzerland, Great Britain, Belgium, Russia and other countries. One of its sections discussed proposals made by the followers of Fourier for improving the social position of the non-propertied classes. The report cites Edouard de Pompery’s speech in which he compared the proletariat’s struggle against private property with the struggle of the bourgeoisie against feudalism.</p>
<p>This report, an excerpt from which Marx quotes below, was published in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 280, October 7, 1842, with a note: “Strassburg, 30. Sept.” </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">81</span><a name="81"></a> This refers to the following proposition from Emmanuel Siey s’ <em>Qu'est-ce que</em> <em>le tiers</em> <em> tat?</em> published in 1789 on the eve of the French revolution: “What is the third estate?

Debates on the Law </em>on <em>Thefts of Wood </em>is one of the series of articles by Marx on the proceedings of the Rhine Province Assembly from May 23 to July 25, 1841. Marx touched on the theme of the material interests of the popular masses for the first time, coming out in their defence. Work on this and subsequent articles inspired Marx to study political economy. He wrote about this in the preface to his <em>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</em> (1859): “In the year 1842-43, as editor of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>, I first found myself in the embarrassing position of having to discuss what is known as material interests. Debates of the Rhine Province Assembly on the theft of wood and the division of landed property; the official polemic started by Herr von Schaper, then Oberpr sident of the Rhine Province, against the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> about the condition of the Mosel peasantry, and finally the debates on free trade and protective tariffs caused me in the first instance to rum my attention to economic questions.”</p>
<p>Excerpts from the speeches by the deputies to the Assembly are cited from <em>Sitzungs-Protokolle des secham Rheinischen Provinzial-Landtags</em>, Koblenz, 1841.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">89</span><a name="89"></a> The second article written by Marx on the proceedings of the Rhine Province Assembly, banned by the censors, was devoted to the conflict between the Prussian Government and the Catholic Church or the so-called church conflict (see Note 42).</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">97</span><a name="97"></a> This note was a footnote to an article marked “Vom Rhein” printed in the same issue. The article in its turn was a reply to a previous article printed in the Supplement to the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> Nos. 265, 268, 275 and 277, September 22 and 25 and October 2 and 4, 1842, under the title “<em>Fehlgriffe der liberalen Opposition in Hannover</em>”. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">98</span><a name="98"></a> The reference is to <em>la Charte b cl e</em>, proclaimed on August 14, 1830 (see Note 61).</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">99</span><a name="99"></a> In 1837 King Ernst Augustus and his supporters made a coup d' tat in Hanover. They abolished the 1833 Constitution which was moderately liberal (according to it ministers were appointed by the king but were responsible to the provincial assembly) and revived the fundamental state law of 1819 which retained representation on the estate principle and drastically restricted the lights of the provincial assembly. Liberal circles in Hanover attempted to restore the 1833 law. Their demand was formulated in a protest by seven professors of the University of G ttingen (Dahlmann, Gervinus, the brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, Ewald, Albrecht and Weber) who were subsequently deprived of their chairs and some of them banished. The controversy on the constitutional questions in Hanover was transferred to the Bundestag, which by a decision of 1839 sanctioned restoration of the law of 1819. The new constitutional Act of the King of Hanover in 1840 re-asserted the principal clauses of the law.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">100</span><a name="100"></a> This article and the article “<em>A Correspondent of the K lnische Zeitung vs. the Rheinische Zeitung</em>” which is closely linked with it (see this volume, pp. 277-79) were written on the occasion of a sharp polemic launched in the press on the proposed reform of local administration in towns and villages of the Prussian provinces. For the Rhine Province this reform meant the abolition of progressive elements in local government which had survived from the time of the French revolution and Napoleon 1. The struggle for their preservation and development assumed the form of defending these principles against Prussian absolutism and monarchically orientated nobility.</p>
<p>The <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> played a leading part in this struggle. Already in August 1842 its editorial board publicly stated its views on this matter. From November 3 to December 1 the paper published in its Supplement a series of articles entitled “The Reform of the Rhenish Administration”, written by Claessen, a member of the paper’s Board of Directors. These articles contained demands for unification and equality of urban and rural local administration, publicity of local administration sessions, extension of their rights and reduction of bureaucratic control over them. Reflecting the Prussophilism and anti-democratic sentiments of a certain section of the Rhenish bourgeoisie the <em>K lnische Zeitung</em> attacked the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> in its “Summing Up” published on November 1, 1842. On November 1 1 and 16 the <em>K lnische Zeitung</em> continued the polemic by publishing short items containing attacks on Claessen’s articles and insinuations against the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>. The two articles mentioned here were in answer to these attacks (see Note 43).</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">101</span><a name="101"></a> In this note Marx laid down the principal lines for the criticism of the Divorce Bin which he later developed in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> in a special article (see this volume, pp. 307-10). Preparation and discussion in government quarters of the Divorce Bill making the dissolution of marriage much more difficult was kept in great secrecy. However, on October 20, 1842, the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> published the Bill and thus initiated broad discussion on this subject in the progressive press. Prior to this article by Marx, the Rheinische Zeitung had published a brief article on the new Bill under the title “<em>Bilmerkungen  ber den Entwurf einer Verordnung  ber Ehescheidung, vorgelegt von dem Ministerium f r Revision der Gesetze im Juli 1842</em>” (<em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 310, November 6, 1842, Supplement). Marx mentions the article in this item which was written in the form of an editorial note to another article devoted to the same subject, “<em>Der Entwurf zu dem neuen Ehegesetz</em>”.</p>
<p>Owing to the general dissatisfaction with the government Bill, Frederick William IV was compelled to abandon his intention of carrying it through.</p>
<p>The publication of the Bill and the resolute refusal of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> editorial board to name the person who had sent the text of it to the paper was one of the reasons for the banning of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>.</p>
<p>In English this note was published in <em>Writings of the Young Marx on Philosophy  and Society</em>, New York, 1967, pp. 136-38.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">102</span><a name="102"></a> This refers to the law of the Kingdom of Prussia codified in 1794; it reflected  backwardness of feudal Prussia in the sphere of law and justice.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">103</span><a name="103"></a> This note reflects Marx’s desire as the editor of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> to use the liberal wording of the Cabinet Order on the press, to which Frederick William IV frequently resorted with demagogic aims, so as to provide juridical barriers against the persecution of the paper being prepared by the censorship and to repulse the harassing action on the part of governmental officials and the reactionary press. Marx resorted to similar tactics also on other occasions when forced to do so by the situation.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">104</span><a name="104"></a> The trend pursued by the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> after Marx became its editor was a source of apprehension for the Prussian authorities. Oberpr sident of the Rhine Province von Schaper wrote to Berlin stressing that the tone of the paper was “becoming more and more impudent and harsh”. By his order Regierungspr sident of Cologne von Gerlach demanded on November 12, 1842, the dismissal from the editorial board of Rutenberg (whom the authorities considered to be the initiator of the radical trend) and conveyed the instructions of the censorship ministries on changes in the paper’s trend. The editorial board replied with a letter by the publisher Engelbert Renard who was the official manager of the paper. As can be seen from the rough copy, the actual author of the letter was Marx.</p>
<p>The arguments put forward by Marx deprived the government representatives of grounds for banning the paper, although it is obvious from von Schaper’s report to the censorship ministers on December 17, 1842, that they did not abandon the intention of bringing a suit against the editors of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>, in particular the author of the article “<em>Debates on the Law on Thefts of Wood</em>”, for “impudent and disrespectful criticism of the existing government institutions”. However, having no formal grounds for prosecution, the authorities had temporarily to confine themselves to intensifying censorship measures (change of censors, etc.).</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">105</span><a name="105"></a> This refers to articles published in the Supplement to the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>: “Auch eine Stimme  ber eine Hegemonie in Deutschland"’ (author, Fidedrich Wilhelm Carovo ; signed ‘Vom Main'), No. 135, May 15, 1842; “<em>Hegemonie in Deutschland</em>”, No. 146, May 26, 1842; <em>and “Weitere Verhandlungen  ber die Hegemonie Preussens</em>”, No. 172, June 21, 1842, when Marx was not yet editor of the newspaper. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">106</span><a name="106"></a> This note was published in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> as a footnote to the article “<em>Die hannoverschen Industriellen und der Schutzzol</em>”. It has not yet been proved who the author of this item was. Some scholars doubt whether it was written by Marx.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">107</span><a name="107"></a> “<em>The</em> <em>Free” (Die Freien</em>) — a Berlin group of Young Hegelians, which was formed early in 1842. Among its prominent members were Edgar Bauer, Eduard Meyen, Ludwig Buhl and Max Stirner (pseudonym of Kaspar Schmidt). Their criticism of the prevailing conditions was abstract and devoid of real revolutionary content and ultra-radical in form; it frequently discredited the democratic movement. Subsequently many representatives of “The Free” renounced radicalism.</p>
<p>When Marx had become editor of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>, he took steps to prevent “The Free” from using the newspaper as a mouthpiece for their pseudo-revolutionary statements. On his conflict with “The Free” see his letter to Arnold Ruge, November 30, 1842 (this volume, pp. 393-95). The article quotes almost word for word from Herwegh’s letter of November 22, 1842 to the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">108</span><a name="108"></a> This is an editor’s note quoted from the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 322, November 18, 1842. The report referred to was published in issue No. 317 of the paper on November 13, 1842. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">109</span><a name="109"></a> Here and elsewhere is quoted the article mentioned below, “Leipzig (Julius <em>Mosen u. die Rhein. Zeitung</em>),” which was published in the <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em> No. 329, November 25, 1842.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">110</span><a name="110"></a> Marx wrote this work in reply to an article in the <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em> which tried to justify the Prussian Government’s attempts to substitute the establishment of the all-German Assembly of the Estates for the introduction of the constitution. The article criticised by Marx, “Berlin, im November. <em> ber die Zusammensetzung der st ndischen Aussch sse in Preussen</em>”, was published in the Supplement to the <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em> Nos. 335 and 336, December 1 and 2, 1842 (below are quoted passages from this article). For reasons of tactics Marx made the reservation that the polemics were directed against the opinion of the conservative press on the Prussian state institutions and not against these institutions themselves. This enabled him to criticise them severely and expose their spurious constitutionalism.</p>
<p class="fst">Commissions of the estates of the provincial assemblies were set up in Prussia in June 1842. They were elected by the provincial assemblies out of their membership (on the estate principle) and formed a single advisory body-the United Commissions. With the help of this body which was but a sham representative assembly, Frederick William IV planned to introduce new taxes and obtain a loan.</p>

The Cabinet Order of December 28, 1842, prohibited distribution of the <em>Leipziger Allgemeine Zeitung</em> in Prussia for the publication, in its issue of December 24, of a letter by Georg Herwegh, a democratic poet, to King Frederick William IV, accusing him of breaking the promise to introduce freedom of the press. The <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> editor’s defence of the persecuted press required particular courage because the paper was increasingly threatened with government repressions.</p>
<p class="fst">Each section of the article was published in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> under its own title, the general title was given by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CC CPSU. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">116</span><a name="116"></a> This refers to the report marked “K ln, 4. Jan.”, published in the <em>K lnische Zeitung</em> No. 5, January 5, 1843. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">117</span><a name="117"></a> This refers to the report marked “Vom Rhein, den 4. Jan.”, published in the <em>Rhein- und</em> <em>Mosel-Zeitung </em>No. 6, January 6, 1843. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">118</span><a name="118"></a> The reference is to the events connected with the abolition of the Constitution by the King of Hanover in 1837 and the protest against this arbitrary act by seven liberal professors of G ttingen University who were subjected to repressions (see Note 99). The Hanover events evoked a wide response all over Germany. The <em>Leipziger Allgemeine Zeitung</em> came out in defence of the G ttingen professors.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">119</span><a name="119"></a> The allusion is to the <em>Augsburg</em> <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em>. At the end of 1842 and beginning of 1843 the newspaper again made a number of attacks against the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> (in particular, in No. 4, January 4, 1843), stating its intention to polemicise on principles with the latter but failing to supply any weighty arguments. In reply, the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> of January 12, 1843, carried a polemical article by Marx against the <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em>, which is published in this volume together with the reply to the paper’s attacks which he made on January 3, 1843 (see this volume, pp. 359-60). </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">124</span><a name="124"></a> Here and below Marx quotes the report marked “K ln, 10. Jan.”, published in the <em>K linische Zeitung</em> No. 11, January 11, 1843. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">125</span><a name="125"></a> This refers to two reports published in the <em>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</em> No. 11, January 11, 1843, the first of which is marked “Koblenz, den 10. Jan.” and the second “Vom Rhein, den 9. Jan.”</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">126</span><a name="126"></a> This refers to the report marked “Koblenz, den 13. Jan.”, published in the Supplement to the <em>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</em> No. 15, January 15, 1843. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">127</span><a name="127"></a> The <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 348, December 14, 1842, carried, on Marx’s initiative, an unsigned article marked “Von der Mosel”, written by the democratic lawyer P. I. Coblenz. The situation in the Mosel was also dealt with in another article marked “Bemkastel, 10. Dez.”, published in issue No. 346. They were printed for the purpose of drawing public attention to the distress of the Mosel peasants and censuring the prejudiced and inattentive attitude of the government circles towards their complaints. The publication of these articles led to two resclipts from von Schaper, Oberpr sident of the Rhine Province, to the newspaper, accusing the Mosel correspondent of distorting the facts and slandering the government. Von Schaper demanded answers to a number of questions, in the hope of securing in effect a disavowal of the accusations levelled at the government. On December 18, issue No. 352 of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> published the rescripts and asked the author to write a reply to them. However, as Coblenz was unable to produce sufficient grounds for his theses and disprove the accusations made against him, Marx took the task upon himself in order to use the polemics against von Schaper to expose the Prussian sociopolitical system. At the time the present announcement of the forthcoming reply to the Oberpr sident was published Marx was gathering material for his article “Justification of the Correspondent from the Mosel”.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">128</span><a name="128"></a> This article was written by Marx instead of P. I. Coblenz, the author of the report “Von der Mosel”, in reply to the charges levelled against the latter in the rescripts of von Schaper, Oberpr sident of the Rhine Province (see Note 127). Marx was unable to carry out his programme for a reply ‘m full -out of five questions he managed to answer only two. Further publication was banned by the censor. The manuscript is not extant. Subsequently a report datelined “<em>Von der Mosel in Januar 1843</em>” entitled<em> “Die Krebswhiiden der Moselgegend</em>”, which coincided with the formulation of the third point of a reply Marx had planned to give, appeared in the book by K.Heinzen, a contributor to the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>,<em> Die Preussische Bureaukratie</em> (Darmstadt, 1845, S. 220-25). However, the content was strictly factual, and the style of this item differed from those parts of Marx’s article which had been published. At present it is still difficult to tell for certain who the author of this report was, but it may be assumed that what Heinzen published under this heading was one of the previously unpubbshed articles by Coblenz, whom Marx defended, rather than the continuation of Marx’s article.</p>
<p>The publication of the article in defence of the Mosel correspondent provided the immediate pretext for the government, at the insistence of the king, to pass a decision on January 19, 1843, banning the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> as from April 1, 1843, and imposing a rigorous censorship for the remaining period. The decree  was promulgated on January 21.</p>
<p>The article was published in part in English in <em>Writings of the Young Marx on</em> <em>Philosophy and Society, </em>New York, 1967, pp. 143-48. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">129</span><a name="129"></a> This refers to the Prussian Government’s new censorship instruction (see Note 39). </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">131</span><a name="131"></a> The two items published here under a title supplied by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism were printed in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> in reply to the attacks of the Augsburg <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em> (see Note 119). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">132</span><a name="132"></a> These notes are the draft reply written by Marx to disprove the accusations contained in the ministerial rescript of January 21, 1843, which ordered suppression of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> as from April 1, 1843, and imposed a rigorous censorship for the remaining period. The manner in which Marx replied was determined by his purpose of shielding the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> against government repressions and securing a repeal of the ban, but not at the cost of a change in its political line. Hence the Aesopean language which he uses in elucidating the paper’s stand on questions of principle in the the life of Germany. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">133</span><a name="133"></a> Marx apparently refers to <em>Das Neue eleganteste Conversatione — Lexicon f r Gebildete aus allen St nde</em>n published in Leipzig in 1835. On p. 255 of this book it was stated that Hegel came to Berlin in 1818 so that “his doctrine might be turned into a state philosophy”. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">134</span><a name="134"></a> This refers to the article “Eingesandt aus Preussen” published in the <em>Allgemeine K nigsberger Zeitung</em> No. 30, February 4, 1843.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">135</span><a name="135"></a> This charge was provoked by the article “<em>Die russische Note  ber die preussische Presse</em>” published in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 4, January 4, 1843. The article criticised Russian Tsarism and the interference of its representatives in German affairs for the purpose of suppressing the opposition press. The publication of this article caned forth a Note of protest from the tsarist government. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">136</span><a name="136"></a> Marx reproduces almost word for word the Prussian censorship instruction of October 18, 1819. </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">140</span><a name="140"></a> This refers to the negotiations between Prussia and Russia which were held in the summer of 1842 on the questions of concluding a trade agreement and cancelling, under the pressure of German public opinion, the 1830 Convention with Russia concerning extradition of deserters, prisoners of war and criminals.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">141</span><a name="141"></a> The Cabinet Order of October 14, 1842, obliging the editorial boards of newspapers to publish government officials’ refutations of incorrect data given in these newspapers, was published in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 320, November 16, 1842.</p>
<p>The editorial note on this Order ironically remarks that whatever the author’s intentions it constituted “a perfect guarantee of the independence’ of the press and recognition of its social significance. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">142</span><a name="142"></a> The quotations which follow are from the article marked “, Vom Rhein, den 6. M rz”, published in the Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung No. 67, March 8, 1843.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">143</span><a name="143"></a> The Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung was published in Koblenz. Further on in the text Marx refers to it as the “Koblenz newspaper”. p. 367</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">144</span><a name="144"></a> Marx further quotes from the article “Friedrich v. Sallet ist totl” published in the <em>Trier’sche Zeitung</em> No. 63, March 6, 1843. This obituary to the German anti-clerical poet was attacked by the pro-Catholic editors of the Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung, which carried in issue No. 70, March 11, 1843, an article entitled “<em>Friedrich v. Sallets Laien-Evangelium</em>”. Marx severely criticises both this article (excerpts from which are also quoted) and attempts of the <em>Trier’sche Zeitung</em> article to describe Sallet as an author with religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">145</span><a name="145"></a> Sanbenito- a yellow robe worn by heretics sentenced by the Inquisition when they were led to the place of execution. </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">147</span><a name="147"></a> After the publication of the rescript of January 21, 1843, which suppressed the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> as from April 1, 1843, Marx directed his efforts to secure its repeal. Neither the refutation of the charges against the newspaper (see this volume, pp. 361-65), nor the petitions of the inhabitants of Colgne and other dries of the Rhine Province in defence of the paper succeeded in shaking the government’s decision. At the end of January 1843 Marx was already thinking of resigning the editorship (see letter to Ruge of January 25, 1843, p. 397 of this volume), but he did not consider it possible to carry out his intention at the height of the campaign for the repeal of the ban. In March, however, he believed that changes in the editorial board could provide a chance of saying the newspaper, and made up his mind to resign officially from his post. He handed over his duties to Dagobert Oppenheim. Marx was probably prompted to do so also by his unwillingness to take upon himself the responsibility for a possible change of line of the newspaper by which the liberal shareholders wished to prolong its existence.</p>
<p class="fst">Notwithstanding Marx’s resignation, the royal rescript was not repealed. The last issue of the newspaper appeared on March 31, 1843.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">148</span><a name="148"></a> Marx’s thesis, together with his applications in German and Latin, was recorded under No. 26 on April 13, 184 1, in-the Jena University Register. On the same day Bachmann, the Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy, and a group of professors signed a highly commentator ,y review on it (see this volume, pp. 705-06). On April 15 Marx was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy and received his diploma (see illustration). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">149</span><a name="149"></a> In mid-April 1841, after he had been awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Marx moved to Trier and in July of the same year to Bonn, because he had intended to enlist as Privat-Docent at Bonn University. In view of the government persecutions of progressive scientists (in the autumn of 1841 Bruno Bauer, a Young Hegelian, was banned from lecturing at Bonn University), Marx had to give up his plans for an academic career and become a publicist.</p>
<p class="fst">From January till March 1842 Marx stayed in Trier in the family of his fianc e, Jenny von Westphalen.</p>
<p class="fst">Marx’s correspondence with Arnold Ruge was occasioned by his intention to contribute to the opposition periodicals of the time including the <em>Deutsche Jahrb cher</em>, edited by Ruge. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">150</span><a name="150"></a> ‘This refers to Ludwig Feuerbach’s review of Karl Bayer’s book <em>Betrachtungen laber den Begriff des sittlichen Geistes und  ber das Wesen der Tugend</em> published in the <em>Hallische Jahrb cher</em> for 1840. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">151</span><a name="151"></a> The full title is <em>Anekdota zur neusten deutschen Philosophie und Publicistik</em> which Ruge planned to publish in Switzerland. The first issue of the almanac (1843) carried Marx’s article “Comments on the Latest Prussian Censorship Instruction” and also articles by Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl. Friedrich K6ppen, Amold Ruge and others. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">152</span><a name="152"></a> The reference is to Bruno Bauer’s book <em>Die Posaune des jungsten Gerichts  ber Hegel den Atheisten und Antichristen</em>. <em>Ein Ultimatum</em> which was published anonymously in early November 1841. Bauer wrote it in August and September 1841 with some assistance from Marx. Bauer and Marx intended to publish the second part of the book as their joint work. However. their co-operation soon came to an end. chiefly be-cause Marx, who wanted to link advanced philosophy more closely with politics, was dissatisfied with Bauer’s tendency to confine himself to radical criticism of theology. After Marx had left Bonn for Trier in January 1842 to see the father of his fianc e, Ludwig von Westphalen, who was dying, Bauer published the second part of Die Posaune as a separate book entitled <em>Hegels Lehre von der Religion und der Kunst von dem Standpunkte des Glaubem aus beuteilt</em> (Leipzig, 1842) without the section which was to be written by Marx — a treatise on Christian art. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">153</span><a name="153"></a> The article did not appear in the publication for which it was written. The manuscript is not extant. later on set forth his criticism of the constitutional monarchy in his <em>Critique</em> <em>of Hegel’s Philosophy of Law</em> written in the summer of 1843 (see present edition, Vol. 3). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">154</span><a name="154"></a> In the autumn of 1841 Bruno Bauer was banned from lecturing by Eichhorn, Minister of Religious Worship, Education and Medicine, and in March 1842 he was suspended from the post of Privat-Docent of Theology at Bonn University for his atheistic views and opposition statements. Bruno Bauer’s letter mentioned by Marx has not been found.</p>
<p class="fst"><em>Lit de justice</em> — sitting of the old French Parliament which was held in the presence of the king, whose directions in that case acquired the force of law.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">155</span><a name="155"></a> This refers to the Cabinet Order of February 18, 1842, concerning revision of the earlier decrees of the Prussia Government (the Cabinet orders of March 6, 1821, and of August 2, 1834) according to which, in respect of certain judicial proceedings, the French Penal Code and trial by jury, which had been applied so far in the Rhine Province, were replaced by Prussian law and secret hearing. Under pressure from the discontented Rhenish bourgeoisie the Prussian Government revised these decrees. However the Cabinet Order of February 18, 1842, contained a number of reservations which in fact retained the Prussian law for cases of high treason, malfeasance. etc. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">156</span><a name="156"></a> This is how Marx ironically calls the official newspapers published in Germany at the time. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">157</span><a name="157"></a> Marx was unable to realise his intention to move to Cologne at the time (see this volume, p. 389). About April 10, 1842, he was to go to back to Bonn where he stayed with interruptions due to visits to Trier for family reasons till early October of the same year. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">158</span><a name="158"></a> <em>Spandau</em> — a fortress in Brandenburg, later included in Great Berlin. It was used for a long time as a prison for state criminals.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">159</span><a name="159"></a> Of the list of articles given by Marx only one was published, namely, “The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law”, in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> (see this volume, pp. 203-10). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">160</span><a name="160"></a> Friedrich Rudolf Hasse’s <em>Ansein von Canterbury</em>, Part I, was published in 1843, Part II appeared in 1852.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">161</span><a name="161"></a> Marx had to leave for Trier at the end of May 1842 because his younger brother Hermann had died. During his stay in Trier (till mid-July 1842, when he returned to Bonn) his conflict with his mother, which had begun earlier, grew more acute. Henriette Marx was displeased with her son’s refusal to embrace an advantageous government or academic career. She stopped paying him allowance and prevented him from receiving his share of his father’s estate. On account of this Marx had to postpone his marriage with Jenny von Westphalen and, moreover,  found himself in very straitened circumstances. </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">163</span><a name="163"></a> On “The Free” see Note 107.</p>
<p>Marx refers to the article in the <em>K nigsberger Zeitung</em> No. 138, June 17, 1842, which announced the aims and tasks of “The Free”. The article was reprinted in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 176, June 25, 1842, and marked “Aus Berlin”.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">164</span><a name="164"></a> Ruge’s article was published in the Supplement to the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 268. September 25, 1842, under the title “S chsische Zust nde”. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">165</span><a name="165"></a> This refers to an unsigned article published in the Supplement to the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 226, August 14, 1842, under the title “<em>Ein Wort als Einleitung zur Frage: entsplicht die Rheinische Kommunal-Verfassung den Anforderungen der Gegenwart?</em>”.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned articles by Karl Heinrich Hermes against Jewry were published in the <em>K lnische Zeitung</em> (Nos. 187 and 211, and in the Supplement to No. 235, July 6 and 30, and August 23, 1842).</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">166</span><a name="166"></a> Apparently, Marx had in mind the unsigned article “Aus dem Hannoverschen” published in the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 241, August 29, 1842. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">167</span><a name="167"></a> The unsigned article “<em>Das Juste-Milieu</em>” was published in the Supplement to the Rheinische Zeitung Nos. 156,228, 230, 233 and 235 of June 5 and August 16,18, 21 and 23, 1842. The author of this article was the Young Hegelian Edgar Bauer, a leader of “The Free”. It was directed against the half-hearted attitude of the liberals. It criticised them from the positions characteristic of “The Free”, that is, from the positions of complete rejection of any progressive role of the liberal opposition to the absolutist feudal system. The clamorous tone of the article served as a pretext for persecutors of the progressive press. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">168</span><a name="168"></a> Marx moved to Cologne in the first half of October 1842, and on October 15 he became editor of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>.</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">175</span><a name="175"></a> Marx intended to enlist progressive German and French intellectuals to contribute to the prospective journal <em>Deutsch-Franz sische Jahrb cher</em>.</p>
<p>The publication of the journal was started by Marx and Ruge only at the beginning of 1844, after Marx had moved to Paris in the autumn of 1843. Only one double issue appeared. Its publication was discontinued mainly due to disagreements between its editors.</p>
<p>The first English translation of Marx’s letter appeared in <em>Karl Marx. Early Texts</em>, Oxford, 1971, pp. 58-60. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">176</span><a name="176"></a> Robert Eduard Prutz’s article entitled “<em>Die Jahrb cher der Gegenwart und die deutschen Jahrb cher</em>” was published in the Supplement to the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 43, February 12, 1843. The author’s intention was to prove that the journal <em>Jahrb cher der Gegenwart</em> (editor Albert Schwegler, published in Stuttgart and T bingen), the publication of which had been announced in the press, could not be regarded, judging by its ideological tendency, as a continuation of the <em>Deutsche</em> <em>Jahrb cher</em>, which had been suppressed by the Government of Saxony. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">177</span><a name="177"></a> Marx refers to the pamphlet by Arnold Ruge and Otto Wigand entitled <em>An die</em> <em>Hohe Zweite Kammer der S chsischen St ndversammlung.

<p class="fst">The review of this pamphlet by Pffitzner was published in the Supplement to the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> Nos. 71 and 73, March 12 and 14, 1843.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">178</span><a name="178"></a> Ruge’s correspondence with the German censors was published in the first volume of <em>Anekdota zur neuesten deutschen Philosophie und Publicistik</em> under the title “Aktenm ssige Darlegung der Cenzurverhiltnisse der Hanischen und Deutschen Jahrb cher in den Jahren 1839, 1841, 1842”. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">179</span><a name="179"></a> The <em>Notebooks </em>written by Marx in 1839 served as preparatory material for his future work on ancient philosophy and were widely used in his doctor’s thesis (see this volume, pp. 25-106). The <em>Notebooks </em>sum up the results of Marx’s research into ardent philosophy and, besides his own views, contain lengthy excerpts in Latin and Greek from the works of ardent authors, chiefly of the Epicurean school of philosophy. The extant manuscript consists of seven notebooks of which five (notebooks 1-4 and 7) carry the heading “Epicurean Philosophy” on the cover. The covers of notebooks 2-4 bear the inscription “Winter Term, 1839”. The covers of notebooks 5 and 6 are not extant. The fifth notebook has several pages missing. The last five pages of the sixth notebook contain excerpts from Hegel’s <em>Encyclopedia</em>, under the heading “Plan of Hegel’s Philosophy of Nature”; as these are not connected with the main content of the <em>Notebooks </em>they are published separately (see this volume, pp. 510-14).</p>
<p><em>The Notebooks </em>were first published in 1927 in Marx/Engels, <em>Gesamtatisgabe,</em> Bd. I. That edition included mainly the text written by Marx himself without the excerpts or his commentaries on them. The full text was first published in Russian in the collection: Marx and Engels, From Early Writings, Moscow, 1956. In the language of the original (with parallel translations into German of the Latin and Greek quotations) the work was first published in Marx/Engels, <em>Werke</em>, <em>Erg nzungsband</em>, Erster Teil, Berlin, 1968.</p>
<p>An excerpt from the sixth notebook was published in English in <em>Writings of the Young Marx on Philosophy and Society</em>, New York, 1967, pp. 51-60.</p>
<p>The present edition gives the quotations from Greek and Latin authors in English. Greek and Latin terms and expressions have been left untranslated only when they were used in the German text in the author’s digressions and commentaries. Vertical lines made by Marx in the manuscript for emphasis are reproduced here in the margins. In quotations from the works of Diogenes laertius (Book X), Sextus Empiricus and Plutarch, the editors give, in square brackets, Roman figures to denote chapters and Arabic figures to denote paragraphs in accordance with the division of the text accepted in publications of the works of these authors. In some cases there are editorial interpolations within quotations (also in square brackets) made on the basis of the sources used by Mar-x to reconstruct the meaning. The general title corresponds to the author’s headings of individual notebooks and to his definition of the subject of the investigation (see foreword to the dissertation, this volume, p. 29), </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">180</span><a name="180"></a> This treatise of Aristotle is not extant. The passage referred to is to be found in Aristotle, <em>De partibus animalium</em> (I, 5). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">181</span><a name="181"></a> in his translation Marx quotes Epicurus according to Petri Gassendi, <em>Animadversiones in decimum librum Diogenes Laertii, qui est De Vita, Moribus, Placitisque Epicuri,</em> Ludguni, 1649. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">182</span><a name="182"></a> The followers of Epicurus received this name because the school of Epicurus in Athens founded in 307-06 B. C. was situated in a garden. The Garden became the main centre of materialism and atheism of Ancient Greece. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">183</span><a name="183"></a> Marx apparently quotes Jakob B hme from Ludwig Feuerbach’s book <em>Geschichte der neuern Philosophie von Bacon von Verulam bis Benedict Spinoza</em>, Ansbach, 1833, S. 161. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">184</span><a name="184"></a> The fifth notebook is not extant in full. The beginning, including the cover, has been lost and the extant part has some pages missing. Still extant are also some separate sheets containing the continuation of the excerpts from the works of Seneca and Stobaeus, the beginning of which is in the extant part of the notebook, and the relevant excerpts from the works of Clement of Alexandria. In the collection From Early Writings (Russ. ed., 1956), these sheets were included in the sixth notebook, which is extant also without its cover or the usual author’s list of works quoted. There are good grounds, however, for including them in the fifth notebook as was done in Marx/Engels, <em>Werke</em>, <em>Erg nzungsband</em>, Erster Teil, Berlin, 1968. The arrangement of the material of notebooks 5 and 6 in this edition corresponds to that in the <em>Werke</em>. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">185</span><a name="185"></a> There are no excerpts from Book VI of Lucretius’ poem <em>On the Nature of Things</em> in the extant manuscript of the <em>Notebooks.</em> </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">186</span><a name="186"></a> See Note 1 80. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">187</span><a name="187"></a> Apparently Marx refers to Chapter IX of Book One of the <em>Metaphysics</em> in which Aristotle criticises Plato’s teaching. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">188</span><a name="188"></a> The reference is to the Enneads, a work by Plotinus. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">189</span><a name="189"></a> There are no excerpts from Cicero’s <em>Tusculanae quaestiones </em>in the extant manuscript though it is mentioned by Marx on the cover of the seventh notebook. But the seventh notebook contains excerpts from Cicero’s work <em>De finibus bonorum et malorum</em>, which is not listed on the cover. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">190</span><a name="190"></a> The <em>Plan</em> <em>of Hegel’s Philosophy of Nature</em> consists of brief notes on the content of those paragraphs of Hegel’s work <em>Encyclopedie der philophischen Wissewchaftem in Grundrisse</em>, 3 Aufl., Heidelberg, 1830, which deal with the philosophy of nature. These notes were made by Marx in 1839 in three versions on five pages of the sixth notebook. The first version covers 5  252-334 of Hegel’s book and most closely reproduces the order in which Hegel sets forth his material. Marx departs from Hegel’s terminology here only in separate cases. The second version covers fewer paragraphs dealing with the philosophy of nature but it is marked by greater independence in systematising the material and in terminology. Most original in this respect is the third version, which, though brief, expounds the contents of Hegel’s philosophy of nature more fully than the previous ones.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">191</span><a name="191"></a> This section contains several poems from Marx’s three albums of poems written in the late autumn of 1836 and in the winter of 1836-37. According to his daughter Laura Lafargue and his biographer Franz Mehring, who had access to his manuscripts after his death, two of these albums bore the title <em>Book of Love, </em>Part I and Part II, and the third, <em>Book of Songs</em>. Each had the following dedication: “To my dear, ever beloved Jenny von Westphalen.” lie covers of the albums with the titles and dedications are not extant. Some poems from these albums were later included by Marx in his book of verse dedicated to his father (published below in full). Recently a copybook and a notebook belonging to Karl Marx’s eldest sister Sophic were discovered among the documents of Heinrich Marx’s heirs in Trier. Alongside verses by different people they contain some by the young Marx. Most of them were taken from other copybooks, but some were new.</p>
<p>Marx was very critical of the literary qualities of his early poems but he believed that they conveyed his warm and sincere feelings (see this volume, p. 11). Later on, his view of them grew even more critical. Laura Lafargue, for example, wrote, “My father treated his verses very disrespectfully; whenever my parents mentioned them, they would laugh to their hearts’ content.” (<em>Aus dem literarischen Nachlass von Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels und Ferdinand Lassalle</em>, Stuttgart, 1902, S. 25-26.) In 1954 the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CC CPSU came into possession of the two albums of Marx’s early verse from the inheritance of his grandson Edgar Longuet, and in 1960 Marcel Charles Longuet, Marx’s great-grandson, presented the Institute with the third album. A number of poems from these albums drew the attention of Marx’s biographers and translators and were published at various times, chiefly abridged, in different publications, in particular, in the books: <em>Aus dem literarischen Nachlass von Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels und Ferdinand Lasalle</em>, Stuttgart, 1902; J. Spargo, Karl Marx, New York,) 1910; M. Oflivier, Marx <em>et Engels poeks, </em>Paris, 1933; Marx/Engels, Werke, <em>Erg nzungsband</em>, Erster Teil, Berlin, 1968; and the magazines <em>Yunost</em> (Youth) No. 11, Moscow, 1958, and <em>Inostrannaya Literatura</em> (Foreign Literature) No. 1, Moscow, 1968. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">192</span><a name="192"></a> This album contains 12 poems of which the ballads Lucinda, Distraught and The Pale Maiden and the poem Human Pride were later included by Marx in the book of verse dedicated to his father (see this volume, pp. 565-71, 581-83, 612-15, 584-86). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">193</span><a name="193"></a> This album is the bulkiest of the three dedicated to Jenny von Westphalen. It contains 53 poems of which <em>Yearning</em>, <em>Siren Song</em>, <em>Two Singers Accompanying Themselves on the Harp and Harmony</em> were included by Marx in the book of verse dedicated to his father (see this volume, pp. 538-39, 542-45, 574-75, 580-81).</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">194</span><a name="194"></a> This album contains 22 poems of which <em>Song</em> <em>to the Stars </em>and <em>The</em> Song <em>of a Sailor at Sea</em> were included by Marx in the book of verse dedicated to his father (see this volume, pp. 608-09, 610-11). Passages from the poems <em>My World, Feelings and Transformation</em> published in this volume appeared in English in the translation by Meta L. Stern in the book: J. Spargo, Karl Marx, New York, 19 10, pp. 42, 43 and</p>
<p class="fst">44. p. 523</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">195</span><a name="195"></a> In this book the young Marx collected samples of his early poetical writings, including ballads, sonnets, romances, songs, translations of Ovid’s elegies, scenes from <em>Oulanen</em> a tragedy in verse, epigrams and jokes. It had as a supplement chapters from his satirical novel Scorpion and Felix. Marx mentioned this book in his letter of November 10-11, 1837 (see this volume, p. 17). Two poems, <em>The Fiddler</em> and <em>Nocturnal Love</em> (published in the first section of this volume), were published by Marx in 1841 in the journal Athen um. The order of the poems in the book differs slightly from the order in the contents drawn up by Marx.</p>
<p>The book was first published in full in German in 1929. Subsequently separate poems were reprinted in biographies and other publications.</p>
<p class="fst">The poem To the Medical Student and excerpts from Epigrams were published in English in R. Payne’s book <em>Marx</em>, New York, 1968, <em>Oulanm</em> in <em>The Unknown Karl Marx</em> by the same author, New York, 1971, pp. 55-94. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">196</span><a name="196"></a> The reference is to Christoph Gluck’s opera <em>Amide</em>. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">197</span><a name="197"></a> The age of Marx’s father is stated in this document inaccurately. According to latest investigations, Heinrich Marx was born in 1777, not in 1782 (see H. Monz, <em>Karl Marx und Trier, Verh ltnisse-Beziehungen-Einflusse</em>, Trier, 1964, S. 130).</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">198</span><a name="198"></a> Concerning Marx’s gymnasium examination papers see Note 1.</p>
<p class="fst">On August 17, 1835, his teacher K pper wrote the following comment on the present composition: “It is profound in thought, brilliantly and forcefully written, deserving of praise, although the topic — the essence of union — is not elucidated, its cause is dealt with only one-sidedly, its necessity is not proved adequately.”</p>
<p class="fst">This essay was first published in English in R. Payne’s book, <em>The Unknown Karl Marx</em>, New York, 1971, pp. 39-43. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">199</span><a name="199"></a> The manuscript of Marx’s essay in Latin was underscored in many places by the examiner Johann Hugo Wyttenbach, headmaster of the gymnasium. In the margins there are a number of remarks in Latin, some of which deal with the content of the work. Thus, there is the following remark at the end of the first paragraph, “See what a broad, almost limitless task you set yourself when you intend to examine the question in this way.” The words at the beginning of the seventh paragraph, “That the Augustan age was unlike this no one can deny”, were commented as follows: “You should have avoided altogether any comparison of this kind and description of the period preceding the Carthaginian Wars as well as the epoch of Nero.” There is a correction to the following words in one of the last paragraphs, “Tacitus also speaks of Augustus and his age with the utmost respect": “Not at all! See <em>Annali</em>, I, 1-10. But you could have refrained from such disquisitions”.</p>
<p>The general remarks at the end of the manuscript signed by Wyttenbach and Loers, teacher of Latin and Greek, say, “With the exception of some passages, which called forth the above remark, and a few mistakes, particularly at the end, the composition reveals a profound knowledge of history and of Latin. But what atrocious handwriting!”</p>
<p>This essay was first published in English in R. Payne’s book, The Unknown Karl Marx, New York, 1971, pp. 44-48. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">200</span><a name="200"></a> In addition to the certificate of maturity issued to Karl Marx by the Trier. gymnasium there are extant rough copies of the certificate, an excerpt from the record of the graduation examinations at the Trier gymnasium, an extract from the report, and a list of the pupils who took the examinations.</p>
<p>The first rough copy of the certificate, which is kept in the archives of the Trier gymnasium, gives a more detailed account of the graduate’s knowledge of Greek: “His knowledge and ability in regard to understanding the classics are almost as good as in Latin, but his skill in translating the classics read at the gymnasium is less owing to lack of solid knowledge of grammar and because he is less sure than in Latin, although he often succeeds in explaining correctly even the more difficult passages; on the whole, he translates quite satisfactorily.” </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">201</span><a name="201"></a> Some letters of Heinrich Marx to his son have reached us in a very bad condition. Undecipherable words or phrases are marked by dots in square brackets. Square brackets are also used to indicate tentative interpretation of illegible words or phrases.</p>
<p class="fst">Not a single one of Karl Marx’s replies to his father’s letters during his stay at Bonn University (October 1835-July 1836) has been preserved. Of his correspondence with his father during his subsequent stay in Berlin (he moved there late in October 1836 from Trier where he had spent his summer vacation and become engaged to Jenny von Westphalen) only one letter dated November 10-11, 1837, remains (see this volume, pp. 10-21). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">202</span><a name="202"></a> Apparently Heinrich Marx refers to    7 and 60 of Immanuel Kant’s <em>Anthologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht</em>, K nigsberg, 1798. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">203</span><a name="203"></a> The letter bears mainly illegible markings and separate words apparently added later by Karl Marx.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">204</span><a name="204"></a> The certificate of release is extant in the form of a copy written by an unknown person and submitted to Jena University together with the other documents sent there by Marx when he applied for a doctor’s degree for his treatise on the history of ardent philosophy (see Note 148). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">205</span><a name="205"></a> The letter has not been found.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">206</span><a name="206"></a> The letter was addressed to his wife and son. Apparently, it was first sent to Henriette Marx in Trier, and from there to Karl in Berlin.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">207</span><a name="207"></a> These lines are Heinrich Marx’s last letter to his son. Heinrich died on May 10, 1838. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">208</span><a name="208"></a> Passages from this letter were published for the first time in Russian in the book: P. Vinogradskaya, <em>Jenny Marx</em>, Moscow, 1964, pp. 20, 55-57.</p>
<p class="fst">The end of the letter is missing. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">209</span><a name="209"></a> The original has a note written by Marx in the right-hand corner: “Permission to issue the leaving certificate to Herr Marx, student of [the Faculty of] Law, 18.3.4l.”</p>
<p>Before the text filled in by the student the form has the following notification: “In accordance with the Ministry directives of September 26, 1829, every student must occupy at lectures during the whole term only that seat the number of which is stated by the respective tutor in the record sheet. If any student is prevented from attending lectures for several days or longer due to any circumstances, no one is allowed to take his seat under any pretext.” </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">210</span><a name="210"></a> The certificate bears the remark “To No. 26” made in April 1841 at Jena University on registration of the application and other documents submitted by Marx for the award of a doctor’s degree (see Note 148). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">211</span><a name="211"></a> See Note 148. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">212</span><a name="212"></a> Jenny von Westphalen uses ironically the expression “Hegeling gentlemen”, a derogatory name given to the followers of Hegel by their rabid opponent Heinrich Leo, historian and publicist. Leo wrote against the Young Hegehans the pamphlet <em>Die Hegelingen.Actenst cke und Belege zu der s. g. Denunciation der ewigen Wahrheit Halle</em>, 1838. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">213</span><a name="213"></a> The announcement of the publication of Bruno Bauer’s book <em>Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte den Synoptiker</em> and his three small articles were carried in the Supplement to the <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em> of August 1, 1841. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">214</span><a name="214"></a> This petition was compiled on January 30, 1843, and illegally circulated among the inhabitants of Cologne. By February 18 it had been signed by 911 citizens. The petition was rejected on March 31, 1843.</p>
<p class="fst">Similar petitions requesting the lifting of the ban on the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> were addressed to the King of Prussia from Aachen, Barmen, Wesel, D sseldorf and a number of other towns. However, all steps taken in defence of the newspaper were fruitless. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">215</span><a name="215"></a> The joint meeting of the shareholders of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> and the editorial board was held in the Cologne casino and lasted for six hours -from 10 a. m. till 1 p.m. and from 5 p.m. till 8 p.m. The debates were so long because of a sharp struggle between the moderate-liberal majority of the meeting who were prepared to denounce the radical-democratic views expounded by the newspaper and to have the petition couched in a tone of loyalty, and those who stood for firm defence of the right of the opposition press to exist. The latter were headed by Marx and upheld his policy as editor. The record of Marx’s statements was very brief. Marx and his followers, however, succeeded in persuading the meeting to refrain from officially denouncing the trend of the newspaper (the petition denounced only the sharp tone of its statements), and this gave the radicals grounds for signing it despite its extremely moderate form.</p>
<p>Brief reports of the meeting were carried in the <em>Aachener Zeitung</em> No. 46, February 15, and in the Frankfurt Journal No. 52, February 21, 1843.</p>
<p>The minutes of the general meeting of the shareholders were later published with insignificant changes in the book <em>Rheinische Briefe und Akten zur eschichte der politischen Bewegung</em> 1830-1850, Essen, 1919, Bd. 1, S. 436-47. The present volume reproduces the minutes according to the book of minutes. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">216</span><a name="216"></a> For details concerning the conflict, see Note 104. This was followed by von Schapees reply to Renard on November 19, 1842 (see <em>Rheinische Briefe und Akten zur Geschichte dei. politischen Bewegung</em> 1830-1850, Essen, 1919, Bd. 1, S. 380-82).</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">217</span><a name="217"></a> The newspaper was suppressed within the borders of Prussia by the Cabinet Order of December 28, 1842 (see this volume, pp. 311-30 and Note 115).</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">218</span><a name="218"></a> Part of this petition was published as a footnote in the book <em>Rheinische Briefe und Akten zur Geschichte der politischen Bewegung</em> 1830-1850, Essen, 1919, Bd. 1, S. 448.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">219</span><a name="219"></a> See Note 175.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">220</span><a name="220"></a> This apparently refers to the book: Marie Lafargue (Laffarge), <em>Memoires de Marie Cappelle, veuve Lafarge,  crits par elle-m me</em>. In 1841 another book on the same subject was published in Leipzig: <em>Marie Lafarge, verurtheilt als Giftmischerin und angeklagt ass Diamantendiebin. Criminalgeschichte den neuesten</em> <em>Zeit.</em> </p>
