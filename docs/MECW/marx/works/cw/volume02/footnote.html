<h3>Editors’ Footnotes from Volume 2</h3>
<p class="fst"><a name="1"></a>
<span class="term">1</span> <em>The Bedouin</em> was Engels’ first work to appear in print. He wrote it at the beginning of his stay in Bremen, where he worked as a clerk in a trading company from July 1838 to March 1841. When preparing this poem for the press the editors of the <em>Bremisches Conversationsblatt</em> changed the last stanza without the author’s permission. The original text is cited by Engels in his letter to the Graeber brothers dated September 17-18, 1838.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="2"></a>
<span class="term">2</span> In this poem Engels ridiculed the heated polemic between the weekly <em>Der Bremer Stadtbote</em> and the newspaper <em>Bremisches Unterhaltungsblatt</em> (see Engels’ letters to his brother Hermann of March 11-12, 1839, and to his sister Marie of March 12, 1839). For fun Engels sent this poem to Der Bremer Stadtbote under the pen-name of Theodor H. (Hildebrand). Not realising its ironical character, the editors published the poem as a regular item against the rival newspaper. The editors of the <em>Bremisches Unterhaltungsblatt</em>, however, perceived the poem’s irony directed against <em>Der Bremer</em> <em>Stadtbote </em>and reprinted it with appropriate comments.</p>
<p>In this volume the poem is given according to the <em>Bremisches Unterhaltungsblatt</em> since the Publishers do not possess a copy of <em>Der Bremer Stadtbote. </em></p>
<p class="fst"><a name="3"></a>
<span class="term">3</span> As can be seen from Engels’ letter to his sister Marie of March 12, 1839 (see this volume, pp. 419-20), this poem was sent to <em>Der Bremer Stadtbote</em> in a fuller version. The publication of Th. Hildebrandt’s poem <em>Book Wisdom</em> was mentioned in the <em>Bremer Wöchentliche Nachrichten</em> No. 36, 2. Beilage, S. 2, for March 25, 1839. However, the Publishers do not possess a copy of <em>Der Bremer Stadtbote</em> containing this poem. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="4"></a>
<span class="term">4</span> “Letters from Wuppertal” is Engels’ first journalistic work with which he started his contributions to the <em>Telegraph für Deutschland</em>, a progressive Hamburg journal published by the Young Germany literary group. In November 1839 Engels’ articles began to appear there under the pseudonym of Oswald (first S. Oswald, then Friedrich Oswald).</p>
<p>The “Letters” evoked a lively response in Barmen and Elberfeld, two neighbouring towns situated in the Wupper valley (in 1930 they merged to form one town, Wuppertal). Wilhelm Blank, a friend of Engels’, wrote to Wilhelm Graeber on May 24, 1839, that all copies of the journal containing the article had been bought up immediately. The Wuppertal philistines were furious with the anonymous author (many believed that the article had been written by some local celebrity, the poet Ferdinand Freiligrath in particular). For the reaction of the Wuppertal bourgeois to the article see also Engels’ letter to Wilhelm Graeber written about April 28-30, 1839. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="5"></a>
<span class="term">5</span> <em>Friends of Light</em> — a religious trend opposed to pietism (see <a href="#7">Note 7</a>), which dominated in the official Lutheran Church. This opposition was one of the expressions of the dissatisfaction of the German bourgeois with Germany’s monarchic regime, based on the estates system, in the 1830s and 1840s. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="6"></a>
<span class="term">6</span> After 1817, when the Lutherans were united with the Reformists (Calvinists) in a compulsory union, its opponents, the Old Lutherans, split away to form a separate trend defending the “true” Lutheran Church. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="7"></a>
<span class="term">7</span> This refers to pietism, a trend in the Lutheran Church that emerged in Germany in the 17th century. Distinguished by extreme mysticism, it rejected rites and attached special importance to personal religious experience. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="8"></a>
<span class="term">8</span> An allusion to the dispute in 1075-76 between Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, the two protagonists in the struggle for supremacy between ecclesiastical and temporal power. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="9"></a>
<span class="term">9</span> After the Vienna Congress (1814-15), many members of the student gymnastic associations, which emerged in the course of the struggle against Napoleonic rule, opposed the reaction of the monarchist landowners and called for the unification of Germany. On October 18, 1817, on the occasion of the tercentenary of the Reformation and the fourth anniversary of the battle of Leipzig, the German students organised the Wartburg festival, which turned into a demonstration against the Metternich regime. In 1819, the student opposition and other free-thinking intellectuals were accused of “demagogy” by the Karlsbad Conference of Ministers of the Chief German States and subjected to reprisals. </p>

<span class="term">12</span> Engels is referring to the review of J. Ch. F. Winkler’s book Harfenklänge printed in the <em>Telegraph für Deutschland</em> No. 208 in December 1838 under the title “Zeichen der Zeit”. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="13"></a>

<span class="term">17</span> <em>Rektoratsschulen </em>was the name given to elementary five-class schools in the Rhine Province and Westphalia. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="18"></a>
<span class="term">18</span> <em>Young Germany</em> (<em>Junges Deutschland</em>) — a literary group that emerged in Germany in the 1830s and was under the influence of Heinrich Heine and Ludwig Börne. In their fiction and journalistic works, the writers of this group (also known as Young Literature), Gutzkow, Wienbarg, Mundt, Laube, Jung and others, expressed the opposition sentiments of the petty bourgeois and intellectuals who advocated freedom of conscience and the press, the introduction of a constitution, the emancipation of women, and so on. Their political views were vague and inconsistent; many of them soon became ordinary liberals.</p>
<p>For the <em>demgogues </em>see <a href="#9">Note 9</a>. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="19"></a>
<span class="term">19</span> Engels is referring to the owners of the Barmen trading company J. P. von Eynern &amp; S6hne, where Ferdinand Freiligrath worked as a clerk in 1837-39.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="20"></a>
<span class="term">20</span> Engels is referring to the following reviews: Dr. F. Dingelstedt, “<em>Ferdinand Freiligrath. Ein Literaturbild</em>”, published in the jahrbuch der Literatur, 1. jg., Hamburg, 1839, and Moritz Carrière, “<em>Gedichte von Ferdinand Freiligrath, Stuttgart und Tübingen, 1838</em>”, published in the <em>Jahrbücher für</em> <em>wissenschaftliche Kritik </em>No. 8, January 1839, Berlin. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="21"></a>
<span class="term">21</span> Allusions to the folk-tale <em>Die Unkenkönigin</em> (The Frog Queen) can be found in Freiligrath’s poem <em>Schwalbenmärchen</em> and to the tale <em>Schneewittchen </em>(Snow-White) in his poem <em>Meerfahrt</em>.</p>
<p>Below Engels mentions Freiligrath’s poems printed in the following publications: Freiligrath, Gedichte, Stuttgart und Tübingen, 1838; <em>Prinz Eugen, der edle Ritter</em> in the <em>Rheinisches Odeon</em>. Hg. v. I. Hub, F. Freifigrath u. A.

Weitere</em> <em>Bruchstücke. Fünf Gedichte ohne einzeine Uberschriften</em>, published in the <em>Morgenblatt für gebildete Stäne</em> No. 218, September 10, 1836. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="22"></a>
<span class="term">22</span> A reference to the second instalment of Freiligrath’s cycle of poems <em>Der ausgewandeu Dichter</em>, published in the <em>Morgenblatt für gebildete Stände </em>No. 218, September 10, 1836 (see <a href="#21">Note 21</a>). </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="23"></a>
<span class="term">23</span> Engels gives this ironical name, <em>Montanus Eremita</em> (mountain hermit), to Vincenz Zuccalmaglio, a German writer who under the pen-name of Montanus published, ü 1836, the book: <em>Die Vorzeit der Länder Cleve-Mark, Jülich-Berg und Westphalen.</em> </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="24"></a>
<span class="term">24</span> Engels is referring to the following publication: Johann Pol, <em>Gedichte, </em>1. Teil, Geistliche Gesänge und Lieder, 2. Teil, <em>Vemischte Gedichte</em>, Heedfeld, 1837.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="25"></a>
<span class="term">25</span> In this poem Engels expressed his attitude to the weekly <em>Der Bremer Stadbote</em>, to which for fun he had sent several months in succession his poems (including <em>To the</em> Enemies, see this volume, p. 5) under the signature of Theodor Hildebrand, passing himself off as its supporter. This poem is also quoted, with minor stylistic changes, in Engels’ letter to Wilhelm Graeber written about April 28-30, 1839. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="26"></a>
<span class="term">26</span> Expressing the attitude of the local bourgeoisie to Engels’ “Letters from Wuppertal”, the <em>Elberfelder Zeitung</em> on April 12, 1839, published an article by Martin Runkel, its editor, sharply attacking the “Letters” and their author. The “Open Letter to Dr. Runkel” was Engels’ reply to this article.</p>
<p>The <em>Elberfelder Zeitung</em> published the “Open Letter” with the following footnote: “We found this article in our premises yesterday without knowing who had sent it in. We are printing it word for word since we wish to be impartial but, for our part, we would note that we shall defend our generally expressed statements in detail only if the Wuppertal letter-writer names himself, just as <em>we </em>have done.” </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="27"></a>
<span class="term">27</span> An allusion to Martin Runkel’s poem Zu <em>Grabbe’s Bildniss </em>printed in the <em>Rheinisches Odeon</em>, 2. jg., Düsseldorf, 1838.</p>
<p>For the Young Germany writers see <a href="#18">Note 18</a>. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="28"></a>
<span class="term">28</span> This item was published in the <em>Telegraph für Deutschland</em> in the “<em>Kleine Chronik</em>” section. Engels also wrote about the sermon in question by F. W. Krummacher in his letter to Wilhelm Graeber on April 30,1839.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="29"></a>
<span class="term">29</span> These are the following publications: <em>Volksbücher, </em>hrsg. v. G. 0. Marbach, Leipzig, 1838-39; <em>Deutsche Volksbücher nach den ächtesten Ausgaben hergestellt v.

<span class="term">31</span> The publication referred to is <em>Leben und Thaten des grossen Helden Heinrich des Löwen, Henog zu Brautuchweig</em>, Einbeck (n.d.). </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="32"></a>
<span class="term">32</span> On December 10, 1835, the Federal Assembly banned the works by writers of the Young Germany group (see <a href="#18">Note 18</a>). Some of them, such as Gutzkow’s <em>Wally,</em> <em>die Zweifierin </em>raised the question of women’s emancipation.</p>
<p><em>The Federal Assembly </em>(Diet) of the German Confederation (1815-66) consisted of representatives of the German states and was a pillar of the conservative monarchical order in Germany. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="33"></a>
<span class="term">33</span> An allusion to Tieck’s comedy Kaiser Octavianus which was based on a German popular book of the same name and published in <em>Ludwig Tieck’s Schriften</em> Bd. 1, Berlin, 1828. </p>

<p class="fst"><a name="36"></a>
<span class="term">36</span> In his article “<em>Der Schwabenspiegel</em>” (in the <em>Jahrbuch der Literatur</em>, 1. jg., Hamburg, 1839), Heine criticised the “Swabian poetical school” which comprised a number of poets and literary critics representative of late romanticism, including Ludwig Uhland, Justinus Kerner, Gustav Schwab, Wolfgang Menzel and Gustav Pfizer.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="37"></a>
<span class="term">37</span> <em>Song of Ludwig</em> — a poem by an unknown medieval poet written in the late 9th century in the Franconian dialect. It glorifies the victory of Ludwig Ill, King of the Western Franks, over the Normans in 881. </p>

<span class="term">38</span> A reference to Gustav Kühne’s book <em>Weibliche und männliche Charaktere</em>, 2 Teile, Leipzig, 1838; and to his article “Deutsche Lyük.

<p class="fst"><a name="39"></a>
<span class="term">39</span> Engels is referring to the following passage from Ludolf Wienbarg’s article “<em>Ludwig Uhland als Dramatiker</em>”, included in his book <em>Die Dramatiker der jetztzeit</em>, 1. Heft, Altona, 1839: “Gustav Pfizer has spoken in and out and round about on the character and talent of Uhland, as a pupil about his teacher, as a friend about his friend and not a word about Uhland the dramatist, What should one conclude from this? Simply that a certain younger writer is right in calling the latter mediocre. The pamphlet by Pfizer which I have in mind appeared about two years ago. It compares Uhland with Rfickert, or rather, it weighs the talents of the two. Let us say it in passing, rather like a grocer”.</p>
<p>Pfizer’s pamphlet Uhland und Rückert. Ein kritischer Versueh wag printed in 1837. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="40"></a>
<span class="term">40</span> Beck’s poem <em>Schlaf wohll </em>included in his collection <em>Stille Lieder </em>was originally published in the Zeitung für die elegante Welt No. 126, June 30, 1838. </p>

<span class="term">41</span> Act I of Beck’s Saul was published in the Zeitung für <em>die elegante Welt </em>Nos. 216-1 9 for November 4, 5, 7 and 8, 1839. On November 25, the <em>Allgemeine Theater-Chronik</em> (No. 143) printed a review by J. P. Lyser entitled “Episoden. Carl Beck als Dramatiker”, while the <em>Telegraph für Deutschland</em>, in its “Kleine Chronik” section, published an anonymous review of Act 1 with a note by Karl Gutzkow.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="42"></a>
<span class="term">42</span> A reference to Gutzkow’s tragedy <em>König Saul</em>, which appeared in print shortly before the publication of Act 1 of Beck’s tragedy <em>Saul</em>. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="43"></a>
<span class="term">43</span> In its issue No. 203, immediately following Engels’ article, the <em>Telegraph für Deutschland</em> printed an article about Beck by Gutzkow entitled “<em>Ergenzung</em>” (“Supplement”) (the end of the article was published in No. 204 under the title “<em>Karl Beck</em>”). In this article Gutzkow subjected Beck’s Stille Lieder to even sharper criticism, emphasising the “childish nature” of his poetry. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="44"></a>
<span class="term">44</span> A reference to the bourgeois revolution of July 1830 in France, the main events of which took place between July 27 and August 2. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="45"></a>
<span class="term">45</span> <em>The Second Silesian School</em> — a literary trend in Germany in the second half of the 17th century that expressed the sentiments of the feudal nobility. Its main exponents were Christian Hofmannswaldau and Daniel Lohenstein. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="46"></a>
<span class="term">46</span> Engels is referring to the following publications: <em>Gesammette Werke des Grafen August von Platen. In Einem Band, Stuttgart und Tübingen</em>, 1839; and <em>Gedichte am dem ungedmaten Nachlasse des Grafen August von PlatenHallermünde. Als Anhang zu den bei Cotta erschienenen itedichten Platem, </em>Strassburg, 1839. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="47"></a>
<span class="term">47</span> <em>Pentarchy</em> — Europe’s political system in the period of the Restoration. It was based on the supremacy of the five Great Powers, England, France, Russia, Austria and Prussia. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="48"></a>
<span class="term">48</span> This is a translation into German of the poem <em>A La invención de La imprenta by Manuel José Quintana</em>, a Spanish poet, politician and supporter of the 18th-century French Enlightenment. The poem was first published in Madrid in 1803 in Quintana’s book <em>Poesias. </em>Engels’ translation was published together with the original in the Gutenbergs-Album issued on the occasion of the quatercentenary of the invention of printing (the official date of the invention is 1440). The anniversary was widely celebrated in Germany in June 1840.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="49"></a>
<span class="term">49</span> Hegelings was a pejorative name for the followers of the Hegelian school coined by their opponent Heinrich Leo, the historian and journalist. In 1838 he published in Hane a pamphlet entitled <em>Die Hegelingen. Actenstücke und Belege zu der S.g. Denunciation der ewigen Wahr</em> which fiercely attacked the Young Hegelians.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="50"></a>
<span class="term">50</span> In his <em>Kampf und Sieg</em> Franz Carl Joel Jacoby extolled the Basques for their support of the Carlists in Spain and the struggle waged against the liberals by the ultramontane clergy in Belgium, in particular the intrigues of the Belgian Jesuit Order which he called the “Belgian nightingale”.</p>
<p><em>Carlists</em> — an absolutist clerical group in Spain that supported Don Carlos, brother of Ferdinand VII, in his claims to the Spanish throne. The Civil War of 1833-40 unleashed by the Carlists (known as the First Carlist War) was in fact a clash between the Catholic feudal and the liberal bourgeois elements in Spain and ended with the defeat of the Carlists. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="51"></a>
<span class="term">51</span> This article appears to have been written in connection with rumours about the proposed suspension of the <em>Zeitung für den Deutschen Adel</em>, which started publication in January 1840. However, the newspaper continued to appear until 1844. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="52"></a>
<span class="term">52</span> This refers to the attacks by Martin Luther, founder of the Lutheran Church, on the Catholic Church and papism in which he relied on the original Greek texts of the Gospels (hence Engels’ comparison of them to “Greek fire”). On October 31, 1517, the beginning of the Reformation in Germany, Luther posted up on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg his 95 Theses refuting certain dogmas of medieval Catholic faith and containing the fundamentals of Lutheranism. An important place in his subsequent activities was occupied by the translation into German and corresponding interpretation of the New and the Old Testament. He completed his translation of the Bible in 1534. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="53"></a>
<span class="term">53</span> Engels is quoting from the “<em>Ankfindigung und Einladung zur Subscription auf die mit dem 1. januar 1840 erscheinende Zeitung für den Deutschen Adel</em>”, published in the <em>Sprecher oder Rheinisch-Westphälischer Anzeiger</em> No. 69, August 28, 1839, and other papers. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="54"></a>
<span class="term">54</span> An allusion to the leading article by Fouqué, editor of the <em>Zeitung für den Deutschen Adel</em>, published in its first issue on January 1, 1840, under the title “<em>Vorwort an unsere Leser</em>”. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="55"></a>
<span class="term">55</span> A reference to Kant’s book <em>Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf</em>, Königsberg, 1795. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="56"></a>
<span class="term">56</span> This work consists of two articles. Engels published them in the <em>Mitternachtzeitung für gebildete Leser,</em> a liberal newspaper that appeared in Brunswick, because he wanted to express his views freely on Karl Gutzkow and the Young Germany group (see <a href="#18">Note 18</a>), something he could not do in Gutzkow’s <em>Telegraph für Deutschland</em>. Engels apparently intended to continue the series by dealing with other aspects of the German literary scene in the late 1830s and the early 1840s, but was forced to cease contributing to the <em>Miternachtzeitung</em> because of his differences with its editor, Eduard Brinckmeier (Engels mentions them in his letter to Levin Schücking of July 2, 1840; see this volume, p. 496).</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="57"></a>
<span class="term">57</span> Gutzkow’s article “<em>Vergangenheit und Gegenwart</em>. 1830-1838” contained a criticism of German literature of that period. It was published in the first and only issue of the jahrbuch der Literatur, which appeared in Hamburg in 1839.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="58"></a>
<span class="term">58</span> The première of Gutzkow’s tragedy Richard Savage oder: <em>Der Sohn einer Mutter</em> took place on July 15, 1839, in Frankfurt am Main. Originally it was printed privately under the pen-name of Leonhard Falk. It appeared under the author’s real name in Leipzig in 1842 in his <em>Dramatische Werke</em>, Bd. 1. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="59"></a>
<span class="term">59</span> Gutzkow’s tragedy <em>König Saul</em> was printed in Hamburg in 1839 as a separate book. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="60"></a>
<span class="term">60</span> A reference to Gutzkow’s Marino Falieri and Hamlet in Wittenberg published in a collection of his unfinished writings entitled Skizzenbuch, Cassel and Leipzig, 1839. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="61"></a>
<span class="term">61</span> The scene in question is from Gutzkow’s <em>Wally, die Zweiflerin</em>, Book Two.</p>
<p class="fst"><a name="62"></a>
<span class="term">62</span> In the preface to his book <em>Die Dramatiker der jetztzeit</em> (see <a href="#39">Note 39</a>) Wienbarg wrote: “I shall begin with Uhland because I see in this misunderstood, original and simple dramatist, so childlike in his manhood, to a certain extent the pure, unaffected type of German dramatist”. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="63"></a>
<span class="term">63</span> Engels is referring to the anonymous article “<em>Moderne Romane</em>” in the <em>Rheinische Jahrbuch für Kunst und Poesie</em>, 1. jrg., Köln, 1840, which reviewed Gutzkow’s novel <em>Blasedow und seine Sohne</em>, printed in Stuttgart in 1838, and other works by contemporary writers. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="64"></a>
<span class="term">64</span> <em>Griseldis, </em>a drama by Friedrich Halm (the pen-name of Ernst Münch-Bellinghausen), was staged in Vienna in 1835 and was a great success. However, when it was published in 1837 it was sharply criticised. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="65"></a>
<span class="term">65</span> After the première of Gutzkow’s Richard Savage in Stuttgart, the local weekly <em>Deutscher Courier</em> (No. 44, November 3, 1839) carried a review of it entitled “<em>Erste Vorstellung von Richard Savage, oder der Sohn einer Mutter, Trauerspiel in 5 Aufzügen von Karl Gutzkow</em>”. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="66"></a>
<span class="term">66</span> The première of <em>Werner, oder Herz und Welt</em> took place in Hamburg on February 21, 1840. The play was published in Gutzkow’s <em>Dramatische Werke</em>, Bd. 1, Leipzig, 1842. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="67"></a>
<span class="term">67</span> One of the reasons why Engels wrote this article, “Modern Polemics”, the second in his series Modern Literary Life, was the publication in the <em>Telegraph für Deutschland</em> (No. 3, 1840) of the article “<em>Haben wir einen modernen Styl?</em>” by Ludwig Wihl, a representative of the Young Germany group. Below Engels refers to this article. </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="68"></a>
<span class="term">68</span> This refers to the satirical comedy by Creizenach, <em>Der</em> <em>schwäbische Apoll,</em> published in 1839, which poked fun at the Swabian school (see <a href="#36">Note 36</a>).</p>
<p>Beck’s article “<em>Literatur in Ungarn</em>” was printed in the <em>Zeitung für die elegante Welt</em> in September 1837 (Nos. 173-81). </p>
<p class="fst"><a name="69"></a>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">120</span><a name="120"></a> This article opens a series of Engels’ writings directed against Schelling. By this time Schelling had abandoned many rationalist elements of his former views and had become a prophet of the mystical religious “positive philosophy” (see <a href="#110">Note 110</a>). He was invited to Berlin by Frederick William IV of Prussia, as a counterweight to the Hegelian school, particularly the Young Hegelians.</p>
<p>On November 15, 1941, Schelling started his course of lectures at Berlin University. Engels attended them as a non-matriculated student. He had come to Berlin from Barmen in the latter half of September 1841 and did military training there in an artillery brigade until August 1842.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Schelling’s lectures which continued until March 18, 1842, are quoted in Engels’ works from his own notes. Only a small part of these lectures were printed at the time (Schelling’s <em>Verlesungen in Berlin, Darstellung und Kritik der Hauptpunkte derselben, mit besonderer Beziehung auf das Verhältniss zwischen Chistenthum und Philosophie von Dr. J. Frauenstadt</em>, Berlin, 1842), the greater part being published only after the author’s death in his Complete Works. See F. W. Schelling, <em>Philosophie der </em>Offenbarung. Simmtliche Werke, II Abt., Bd. I-IV, Stuttgart und Augsburg, 1856-1861.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">121</span><a name="121"></a> This pamphlet is Engels’ major work directed against Schelling’s mystical religious concepts. It was written at the same time as Schelling was lecturing at Berlin University and is mainly a critique of the opening lectures of Schelling’s course.</p>
<p>The pamphlet was published anonymously (it was not until the summer of 1842, in an article against Jung which he signed Friedrich Oswald, that Engels confirmed his authorship; see this volume, p. 295) and soon attracted the attention of various public circles. Schelling’s followers described Engels’ criticism as “absurd attacks” (see the <em>Jahrbuch der deutschen Universitäten</em>, II, Leipzig, 1842, S. 22), while the Young Hegelians acclaimed the pamphlet. The <em>Deutsche Jahrbücher</em>, a Young Hegelian journal, published a special article on the pamphlet (in Nos. 126-28, May 28, 30-31, 1842) by its editor, Arnold Ruge, which noted the author’s spirit and lucidity in his criticism of Schelling’s views. When Ruge learned later that the pamphlet was written by Engels he wrote to him inviting him to contribute to the journal and addressing him as a “Doctor” (see Engels’ reply to Ruge of June 15, 1842).</p>

The <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>, published with the active co-operation of Young Hegelians, came out in defence of the pamphlet (in No. 138, May 18, and No. 157, June 6, 1842), as did several other progressive German periodicals.

<span class="term">140</span> Engels appears to be referring to the revolts against the July monarchy, which occurred in a number of industrial centres in France in the 1830s. In November 1831 the weavers of Lyons rose in a revolt which was followed, in June 1832, by an armed uprising of the Paris workers led by the petty-bourgeois republicans. A second revolt of the Lyons workers broke out in April 1834 and was supported by armed struggle under republican slogans in Paris, Saint-Etienne, Grenoble, Clermont-Ferrand and other towns. Both revolts in Lyons were an important landmark in the history of the proletariat’s struggle for liberation and marked a step forward in the independent class movement of the proletariat.</p>

<span class="term">141</span> This article about Jung’s book marked Engels’ final break with the Young Germany literary group (see <a href="#18">Note 18</a>), whose political and ideological views he had begun to question earlier. When he moved to Berlin in September 1841 and made contact with the Young Hegelians he became increasingly convinced that political half-heartedness and hostility to philosophical radicalism of the Young Germany movement made it incapable of becoming the exponent of progressive ideas and the champion of consistent struggle against outdated institutions. In December 1841, he ceased contributing to Gutzkow’s journal, <em>telegraph für Deutschland</em>, and later decided publicly to dissociate himself from the Young Germany group and to subject the weak aspects of their outlook and literary activity to open criticism. This he did in the <em>Deutsche Jahrbücher</em>, a journal edited by the Young Hegelian Arnold Ruge.</p>
<p>In reply to Engels’ criticism Jung wrote a scornful article entitled “Ein Bonbon für den kleinen Oswald, meinen Gegner in den <em>Deutschen Jahrbücher</em>.” (<em>Königsberger Literatur-Blatt</em> No. 42, July 20, 1842).</p>

<span class="term">157</span> Engels is referring to Johann Jacoby, author of the anonymous pamphlet <em>Vier Fragen beantwortet von einem Ostpreussen</em>, Mannheim, 1841, in which he criticised the Prussian state system and called for a constitution in Prussia. This pamphlet resulted in legal proceedings against its author. Although in its verdict of April 20, 1842, the Berlin court acquitted Jacoby of high treason, he was nevertheless sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment for disrespectful criticism of the laws of the land and <em>lése-majesti. </em>It was only the Senate of Appeal of the Supreme Court that unconditionally acquitted Jacoby in its ruling of January 20, 1843.</p>
<p>In 1842, during the judicial inquiry, Jacoby published a pamphlet in Switzerland entitled <em>Meine weitere</em> <em>Vertheidigung wider die gegen mich erhobene Beschuldigung der Majestätsbeleidigung</em> <em>und des frechen, unehrerbietigen Tadels des Landesgesetzes, </em>Zürich und Winterthur, 1842.

<span class="term">160</span> This poem is a parody on the struggle between the Young Hegelians and the conservative opponents of the Hegelian philosophy (Sack and others) who took part in the slander campaign against Bruno Bauer. ‘ne poem was written as a protest against Bruno Bauer’s dismissal from Bonn University in late March 1842 (see <a href="#134">Note 134</a>). Engels wrote it together with Bruno’s brother Edgar. The poem was widely commented on in the German and Swiss press. Its publication was announced in the radical Zurich paper <em>Schweizischer Republikaner </em>on December 9, 1842 (No. 98). Excerpts from it were reprinted in several Leipzig periodicals, among them <em>Friekugeln</em> No. 52, December 30, 1842. Comments on it appeared in the <em>Hamburger Literarische und Kritische Blätter</em> (No. 220, December 19, 1842) and the <em>Hamburger Neue Zeitung</em> (No. 303, December 31, 1842).</p>

<span class="term">164</span> “The Free"-the Berlin group of Young Hegelians which was formed in the first half of 1842 and was led by Edgar Bauer, Eduard Meyen, Ludwig Buhl and Max Stirner (pseudonym of Caspar Schmidt). Its members advocated radical and atheistic views and condemned the half-heartedness of liberalism.</p>
<p>The fact that “The Free” lacked any positive programme and ignored the realities of political struggle soon led to differences between them and the representatives of the revolutionary-democratic wing of the German opposition movement. A sharp conflict arose between “The Free” and Marx in the autumn — of 1842, after Marx had become editor of the Rheinische Zeitung (see present edition, Vol. 1, pp. 393-95).</p>
<p>During his stay in Berlin Engels associated closely with “The Free” but, unlike many of them, he held that it was necessary to go beyond purely atheistic propaganda and take part in the actual struggle for political liberties and democracy. Engels’ revolutionary-democratic convictions, which found expression in the satirical poem <em>The Insolently Threatened Yet Miraculously Rescued Bible, </em>together with his developing materialistic outlook, led to his parting company with “The Free” and the Young Hegelian trend in general.</p>

Its beginning exists in manuscript (see present edition, Vol. 1, pp. 182-83).</p>
<p>On May 29, 1842, the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> began publishing excerpts from De la Centralisation, a pamphlet by Louis Cormenin which appeared in Paris in 1842 under the pseudonym of Timon.

In the latter half of November he was sent to England to study commerce at a cotton mill in Manchester which was owned by a firm of which his father was a partner. On his way from Berlin to Barmen and again before his departure to England Engels visited the editorial office of the Rheinische Zeitung in Cologne to discuss his future work on the newspaper. During his second visit to Cologne, at the end of November 1842, Engels met Marx who was the editor of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> at the time. This first personal encounter was somewhat cool since Marx disagreed strongly with the Berlin group of “The Free” to which Engels then belonged. This, however, did not prevent him from forming a high opinion of Engels as a prospective English correspondent of the newspaper. Engels sent his first item from England immediately after his arrival there.</p>

<span class="term">184</span> The Com Laws (first adopted in England as far back as the 15th century) introduced high import tariffs on agricultural produce in order to maintain high prices on the home market. In 1815 the import of foreign grain was prohibited as long as its price in England was below 80s. per quarter (according to the 1822 Act-below 70s. per quarter). In 1828, a sliding-scale of duties was introduced according to which import tariffs on grain were raised -h- its prices on the home market fell and lowered when the price of grain went up. In 1838 the Manchester factory owners Cobden and Bright founded the Anti-Corn Law League, which demanded the lifting of the corn tariffs and urged unlimited freedom of trade for the purpose of weakening the economic and political power of the landed aristocracy and reducing workers’ wages. The struggle between the industrial bourgeoisie and the landed aristocracy over the Corn Laws ended in 1846 with their repeal.</p>

<span class="term">211</span> Engels is referring to the decision of the Federal Diet to ban works by the writers of the Young Germany movement (see <a href="#32">Note 32</a> and <a href="#199">Note 199</a>). Karl Gutzkow’s novel <em>Wally, die Zweiflerin</em> was one of the pretexts for this decision and also for arresting and prosecuting the author. Gutzkow was arrested in late November 1835, and on January 13, 1836, sentenced to one month’s imprisonment for “blasphemous views, disrespect for the Christian faith and the Church and depicting immoral situations”.</p>

<span class="term">212</span> For Börne’s essay on Schiller’s <em>Wilhelm Tell</em> see <a href="#205">Note 205</a>. It was evidently about this time that Engels began translating works by Shelley, who was one of his favourite poets. In 1840, he consulted the radical German writers Levin Schücking and Hermann Pütmann on the preparation and publication of a collection of Shelley’s poems (see this volume, pp. 494-95).</p>
<p>Engels’ translations have not come to light.</p>

<p><em>Précis historique, politique et militaire de sa révolution</em>, T. I-II, Paris, 1833.

<span class="term">216</span> In his <em>Odysseus Redivivus, </em>a work which has not come to light, Engels apparently described one of the heroes of the national liberation struggle waged by the Greeks against Turkish rule in 1821-25.</p>
<p>Engels sympathised deeply with the struggle of the Greek people for their freedom even when he was quite young. This is evident from his unfinished <em>Pirate Tale </em> which he wrote while still at school.</p>

<span class="term">228</span> During the war against Napoleon, Frederick William III, King of Prussia, recognised the Spanish Constitution of 1812 (see <a href="#100">Note 100</a>). In December 1822, however, the Verona Congress of the Holy Alliance adopted a decision, sponsored by the Emperors of Russia and Austria and the Prussian King, sanctioning an armed intervention by France against revolutionary Spain. On April 7, 1823, French troops invaded Spain, the absolute power of Ferdinand VI1 was restored and the 1812 Constitution again abrogated (it was first declared null and void by the clerical and aristocratic circles in May 1814 but then restored during the second Spanish revolution of 1820-23).</p>
