<h2 id="HGL121">Section Three: The Idea</h2>
<span class="vil">The Idea is the <i>adequate Notion</i>, that which is objectively <i>true</i>, or the <i>true as such</i></span>. When anything whatever possesses truth, it possesses it through its Idea, or, <i>something possesses truth only in so far as it is Idea</i>. The expression '<i>idea</i>' has often been employed in philosophy as in ordinary life for 'notion', indeed, even for a mere ordinary conception: 'I have no idea yet of this lawsuit, building, neighbourhood', means nothing more than the ordinary conception. <a name="HL3_755a"></a><span class="vil">Kant has reclaimed the expression Idea for the <i>notion of reason</i>. Now according to Kant, the notion of reason is supposed to be the notion of the <i>unconditioned</i>, but a notion <i>transcendent</i> in regard to phenomena, that is, no <i>empirical use</i> can be made of such notion that is <i>adequate to it</i>. The notions of reason are to serve for the comprehension of perceptions, the notions of the understanding for understanding them. But in fact, if the latter really are <i>Notions</i>, then <i>they are Notions</i> — they enable one to comprehend , and an <i>understanding</i> of perceptions by means of notions of the understanding will be a <i>comprehension</i> of them.</span> <br/><a name="1632"></a>

But if understanding is only a determining of perceptions by such categories as for example whole and parts, force, cause, and the like, it signifies only a determining by reflection; and similarly, by understanding can be meant only the specific <i>representation</i> of a completely determined sensuous content; thus when someone, having been directed that at the end of the wood he must turn left, replies 'I <i>understand</i>', <i>understanding</i> means nothing more than the grasping of something in pictorial thought and in memory. '<i>Notion of reason</i>', too, is a somewhat clumsy expression; for the Notion is something altogether rational; and in so far as reason is distinguished from understanding and the Notion as such, it is the totality of the Notion and of objectivity. In this sense the Idea is the <i>rational</i>; it is the unconditioned, because only that has conditions which essentially relates itself to an objectivity, but an objectivity that it has not itself determined but which still confronts it in the form of indifference and externality, just as the external end still had conditions. <br/><a name="1633"></a>

Reserving then the expression 'Idea' for the objective or real Notion and distinguishing it from the Notion itself and still more from mere pictorial thought, we must also reject even more vigorously that estimate of the Idea according to which it is not anything actual, and true <a name="HL3_755b"></a> <span class="vil">thoughts are said to be <i>only ideas</i></span>. <a name="HL3_756"></a><span class="vil"> If <i>thoughts</i> are merely <i>subjective</i> and contingent, they certainly have no further value; but in this respect they are not inferior to temporal and contingent <i>actualities</i> which likewise have no further value than that of contingencies and phenomena. On the other hand if, conversely, the Idea is not to have the value of truth, because in regard to phenomena it is <i>transcendent</i>, and no congruent object can be assigned to it in the world of sense, this is an odd misunderstanding that would deny objective validity to the Idea because it lacks that which constitutes Appearance, namely, the <i>untrue being</i> of the objective world. </span> <a name="HL3_756a"></a> In regard to practical Ideas, Kant recognises that 'nothing can be more harmful and unworthy of a philosopher than the <i>vulgar</i> appeal to an <i>experience</i> that allegedly conflicts with the Idea. This very experience would not even exist if, for example, political institutions had been established at the proper time in conformity with Ideas, and if <i>crude conceptions</i>, crude just because they had been drawn from experience, had not taken the place of Ideas and so nullified every good intention.' Kant regards the Idea as a necessity and as the goal which, as the <i>archetype</i>, it must be our endeavour to set up for a maximum and to which we must strive to bring the condition of the actual world ever nearer.  <br/><a name="HL3_756b"></a>
<span class="vil"> But having reached the result that the Idea is the unity of the Notion and objectivity, is the true, it must not be regarded merely as a <i>goal</i> to which we have to approximate but which itself always remains a kind of <i>beyond</i>; on the contrary, we must recognise that everything actual is only in so far as it possesses the Idea and expresses it. It is not merely that the object, the objective and subjective world in general, <i>ought to be congruous</i> with the Idea, but they are themselves the congruence of Notion and reality; the reality that does not correspond to the Notion is mere <i>Appearance</i>, the subjective, contingent, capricious element that is not the truth. </span> <br/><a name="1635"></a>

When it is said that no object is to be found in experience that is perfectly congruous with the Idea, one is opposing the <i>Idea</i> as a subjective standard to the actual; but what anything actual is supposed in truth <i>to be</i>, if its Notion is not in it and if its objectivity docs not correspond to its Notion at all, it is impossible to say; for it would be nothing. It is true that the mechanical and chemical object, like the nonspiritual subject and the spirit that is conscious only of the finite, not of its essence, do not, according to their various natures, have their Notion existent in them <i>in its own free form</i>.<br/>
<a name="HL3_757"></a>
But they can only be true at all in so far as they are the union of their Notion and reality, of their soul and their body. Wholes like the state and the church cease to exist when the unity of their Notion and their reality is dissolved; man, the living being, is dead when soul and body are parted in him; dead nature, the mechanical and chemical world — taking, that is, the dead world to mean the inorganic world, otherwise it would have no positive meaning at all — dead nature, then, if it is separated into its Notion and its reality, is nothing but the subjective abstraction of a thought form and a formless matter. <i>Spirit</i> that was not Idea, was not the unity of the Notion with its own self, or the Notion that did not have the Notion itself for its reality would be dead, spiritless spirit, a material object. <br/><a name="1636"></a>

The Idea being the unity of Notion and reality, <i>being</i> has attained the significance of <i>truth</i>; therefore what now is is only what is Idea. Finite things are finite because they do not possess the complete reality of their Notion within themselves, but require other things to complete it — or, conversely, because they are presupposed as objects, hence possess the Notion as an external determination. The highest to which they attain on the side of this finitude is external purposiveness. That actual things are not congruous with the Idea is the side of their <i>finitude</i> and <i>untruth</i>, and in accordance with this side they are <i>objects</i>, determined in accordance with their various spheres and in the relationships of objectivity, either mechanically, chemically or by an external end. That the Idea has not completely leavened its reality, has imperfectly subdued it to the Notion, this is a possibility arising from the fact that the Idea itself has a <i>restricted content</i>, that though it is essentially the unity of Notion and reality, it is no less essentially their difference; for only the object is their immediate, that is, merely <i>implicit</i> unity. But if an object, for example the state, <i>did not correspond at all</i> to its Idea, that is, if in fact it was not the Idea of the state at all, if its reality, which is the self-conscious individuals, did not correspond at all to the Notion, its soul and its body would have parted; the former would escape into the solitary regions of thought, the latter would have broken up into the single individualities.<br/><a name="HL3_758"></a>

But because the Notion of the state so essentially constitutes the nature of these individualities, it is present in them as an urge so powerful that they are impelled to translate it into reality, be it only in the form of external purposiveness, or to put up with it as it is, or else they must needs perish. The worst state, one whose reality least corresponds to the Notion, in so far as it still exists, is still Idea; the individuals still obey a dominant Notion.<br/><a name="1638"></a>

However, the Idea has not merely the more general meaning of the <i>true being</i>, of the unity of <i>Notion</i> and <i>reality</i>, but the more specific one of the unity of <i>subjective Notion</i> and <i>objectivity</i>. That is to say, the Notion as such is itself already the identity of itself and <i>reality</i>; for the indefinite expression 'reality' means in general nothing else but <i>determinate being</i>, and this the Notion possesses in its particularity and individuality. Similarly too, <i>objectivity</i> is the total <i>Notion</i> that out of its determinateness has withdrawn into <i>identity</i> with itself. In the former subjectivity the determinateness or difference of the Notion is an <i>illusory being</i> [semblance] that is immediately sublated and has withdrawn into being-for-self or negative unity; it is an <i>inhering</i> predicate. But in this objectivity the determinateness is posited as an immediate totality, as an external whole. Now the Idea has shown itself to be the Notion liberated again into its subjectivity from the immediacy in which it is submerged in the object; to be the Notion that distinguishes itself from its objectivity, which however is no less determined by it and possesses its substantiality only in that Notion. 'This identity has therefore rightly been defined as the <i>subject-object</i>, for it is as well the formal or subjective Notion as it is the object as such. But this must be understood more precisely. The Notion, having truly attained its reality, is this absolute judgment whose <i>subject</i>, as self-related negative unity, distinguishes itself from its objectivity and is the latter's being-in-and-for-self, but essentially relates itself to it through itself; it is therefore its <i>own end</i> and the <i>urge</i> to realise it; but for this very reason the subject does not possess objectivity in an immediate manner, for if it did it would be merely the totality of the object as such lost in objectivity; on the contrary, objectivity is the realisation of the end, an objectivity <i>posited</i> by the activity of the end, an objectivity which, as <i>positedness</i>, possesses its subsistence and its form only as permeated by its subject. As objectivity, it has in it the moment of the <i>externality</i> of the Notion and is therefore in general the side of finitude, change and Appearance, a side, however, which meets with extinction in its retraction into the negative unity of the Notion; the negativity whereby its indifferent mutual externality exhibits itself as unessential and a positivity, is the Notion itself.<br/><a name="HL3_759"></a>

The Idea is, therefore, in spite of this objectivity utterly <i>simple</i> and <i>immaterial</i>, for the externality exists only as determined by the Notion and as taken up into its negative unity; in so far as it exists as indifferent externality it is not merely at the mercy of mechanism in general but exists only as the transitory and untrue. Although therefore the Idea has its reality in a material externality, this is not an abstract <i>being</i> subsisting on its own account over against the Notion; on the contrary, it exists only as a <i>becoming</i> through the negativity of indifferent being, as a simple determinateness of the Notion.<br/><a name="HL3_759a"></a>

This yields the following more precise definitions of the Idea. <span class="vil">First, it is the simple truth, the identity of the Notion and objectivity as a <i>universal</i></span> in which the opposition and subsistence of the particular is dissolved into its self-identical negativity and is equality with itself. <a name="HL3_759b"></a> <span class="vil">Secondly, it is the <i>relation</i> of the explicit subjectivity of the simple Notion and its objectivity which is <i>distinguished</i> therefrom; the former is essentially the <i>urge</i> to sublate this separation,</span> and the latter is the indifferent positedness, the subsistence that is in and for itself null. <br/>
<a name="HL3_759c"></a>
<span class="vil">As this relation, the Idea is the <i>process</i> of sundering itself into individuality and its inorganic nature, and again of bringing this inorganic nature under the power of the subject and returning to the first simple universality. The <i>identity</i> of the Idea with itself is one with the <i>process</i>; the thought which liberates actuality from the illusory show of purposeless mutability and transfigures it into the Idea must not represent this truth of actuality as a dead repose, as a mere <i>picture</i>, lifeless, without impulse or movement, as a genius or number, or an abstract thought; by virtue of the freedom which the Notion attains in the Idea, the Idea possesses within itself also the <i>most stubborn opposition</i>; its repose consists in the security and certainty with which it eternally creates and eternally overcomes that opposition, in it meeting with <i>itself</i>.</span> <br/><a name="HL3_760"></a>

In the first instance, however, the Idea is once again only <i>immediate</i> or only in its Notion; objective reality is, it is true, conformable to the Notion, but it is not yet liberated into the Notion, and the latter does not exist explicitly <i>for itself as Notion</i>. <br/>

Thus though the Notion is soul, it is soul in the guise of an <i>immediate</i>, that is, its determinateness does not appear <i>as</i> soul itself, it has not grasped itself as soul, it does not possess its objective reality within itself; the Notion is as a soul that is not yet <i>fully a soul</i>. <br/><a name="1642"></a>

At this first stage the Idea is <i>Life</i>: the Notion that, distinguished from its objectivity, simple within itself, pervades its objectivity and, as its own end, possesses its means in the objectivity and posits the latter as its means, yet is immanent in this means and is therein the realised end that is identical with itself. This Idea, on account of its immediacy, has <i>individuality</i> for the form of its existence. But the reflection-into-self of its absolute process is the sublating of this immediate individuality; thereby the Notion which, as universality in this individuality, is the <i>inwardness</i> of the latter, converts the externality into universality, or posits its objectivity as being the same as itself. <br/><a name="HL3_760a"></a>

In this second stage, <span class="vil">the Idea is the Idea of the <i>true</i> and the <i>good</i> as <i>cognition</i> and <i>volition</i></span> . In the first instance, it is finite cognition and finite volition, in which the true and the good are still distinguished and each appears as yet only as a <i>goal</i>. The Notion has, in the first instance, liberated itself into itself and as yet given itself only an <i>abstract objectivity</i> for its reality. But the process of this finite cognition and action converts the initially abstract universality into a totality, whereby it becomes a <i>complete objectivity</i>. Or, to consider it from the other side, finite, that is, subjective spirit, <i>makes</i> for itself the <i>presupposition</i> of an objective world, just as life <i>has</i> such a presupposition; but its activity consists in sublating this presupposition and converting it into a positedness. In this way its reality is for it the objective world, or conversely, the objective world is the ideality in which it cognises itself. <br/><a name="1644"></a>

Thirdly, spirit cognises the Idea as its <i>absolute truth</i>, as the truth that is in and for itself; the infinite Idea in which cognition and action are equalised, and which is the <i>absolute knowledge of itself</i>.<br/><a name="HL3_761"></a>
<h3 id="HGL122">Chapter 1 Life</h3>
<span class="vil">The Idea of Life is concerned with a subject matter so concrete, and if you will, so real, that with it we may seem to have overstepped the domain of logic as it is commonly conceived</span>. Certainly, if logic were to contain nothing but empty, dead forms of thought, there could be no mention in it at all of such a content as the Idea of Life. But if absolute truth is the subject matter of logic, and <span class="vil"><i>truth</i> as such is essentially <i>in cognition</i></span>, then <i>cognition</i> at least would have to be discussed. So called <a name="HL3_761a"></a><span class="vil">pure logic is usually followed up with an <i>applied logic</i></span> — a logic dealing with <i>concrete cognition</i>, not to mention the mass of <i>psychology</i> and <i>anthropology</i> that it is often deemed necessary to interpolate into logic. But the anthropological and psychological side of cognition is concerned with its <i>manifested aspect</i>, in which the Notion on its own account has not yet come to have an objectivity the same as itself, that is, to have itself for object. The part of logic that treats of this concrete side does not belong to <i>applied logic</i> as such; if it did, then <a name="HL3_761b"></a><span class="vil">every science would have to be dragged into logic, for each is an applied logic in so far as it consists in apprehending its subject matter in forms of thought and the Notion</span>. The subjective Notion has presuppositions which present themselves in psychological, anthropological and other forms. But to logic belong only the presuppositions of the pure Notion in so far as they have the form of pure thoughts, of abstract essentialities, that is, the determinations of <i>being</i> and <i>essence</i>. Similarly, in respect of <i>cognition</i>, the Notion's apprehension of itself, logic will not deal with other shapes of its presupposition but only with that which is itself Idea; this latter, however, necessarily falls to be dealt with in logic. Now this presupposition is the <i>immediate</i> Idea; for since <span class="vil">cognition</span> is the Notion in so far as this is for itself but as a subjectivity is in relation to an objectivity, the Notion is related to the Idea as <i>presupposed</i> or <i>immediate</i> Idea. But the immediate Idea <span class="vil">is <i>life</i></span>.  <br/><a name="HL3_762"></a>

To this extent the necessity of treating of the Idea of life in logic would be based on the necessity, otherwise recognised, too, of treating here of the concrete Notion of cognition. But this Idea has come upon the scene through the Notion's own necessity; the <i>Idea, </i>that which is <i>true </i>in and for itself, is essentially the subject matter of logic; since it is at first to be considered in its immediacy, it must be apprehended and cognised in this determinateness in which it is <i>life, </i>in order that its treatment shall not be an empty affair devoid of determinate content. All that we need perhaps to remark is how far the logical view of life differs from any other scientific view of it; this is not the place, however, to concern ourselves with how life is treated in the unphilosophical sciences, but only with differentiating logical life as pure Idea from natural life which is dealt with in the <i>philosophy of nature, </i>and from life in so far as it stands in connection with <i>spirit. </i>The former of these, as the life of nature, is life as projected into the <i>externality of existence </i>and having its <i>condition </i>in inorganic nature, and where the moments of the Idea are a multiplicity of actual formations. Life in the Idea is without such <i>presuppositions </i>which are in the form of shapes of actuality; its presupposition is the <i>Notion </i>as we have considered it, on the one hand as subjective, on the other hand as objective. In nature life appears as the highest stage, a stage that nature's externality attains by withdrawing into itself and sublating itself in subjectivity. In Logic it is simple inwardness [<i>Insichsein</i>], which in the Idea of life has attained an externality that genuinely corresponds to it; the Notion that earlier appeared on the scene as subjective Notion is the soul of life itself; it is the urge that mediates for itself its reality throughout objectivity. Nature, having reached this Idea from the starting point of its externality, transcends itself; its end does not appear as its beginning, but as its limit, in which it sublates itself. Similarly, in the Idea of life the moments of its reality do not receive the shape of external actuality but remain enclosed within the form of the Notion.<br/><a name="1647"></a>
<i>In spirit, </i>however, life appears partly as opposed to it, partly as posited as at one with it, this unity being reborn as the pure offspring of spirit. For here life is to be taken generally in its proper sense as <i>natural life, </i>for what is called the <i>life of spirit </i>as spirit, is its peculiar nature that stands opposed to mere life; just as we speak, too, of the nature of <i>spirit, </i>although spirit is not a natural being and is rather the opposite of nature. Life as such, then, is for spirit partly a <i>means, </i>and as such spirit opposes it to itself; partly spirit is a living individual and life is its body; and again, this unity of spirit with its living corporeality is born from spirit itself as an <i>ideal. </i>None of these relations to spirit concerns logical life and life is to be considered here neither as instrument [<i>Mittel</i>] of a spirit, nor as a moment of the ideal and of beauty. In both cases, as <i>natural </i>life and as life standing in relation <i>with spirit,</i> life possesses a <i>determinateness of its externality, </i>in the first case through its presuppositions which are other formations of nature, in the second case through the ends and the activity of spirit. The Idea of life by itself is free from the former presupposed and conditioning objectivity as well as from relation to the latter subjectivity.<br/><a name="HL3_763"></a>

Life, considered now more closely in its Idea, is in and for itself absolute <i>universality; </i>the objectivity that it possesses is permeated throughout by the Notion and has the Notion alone for substance. What is distinguished as part, or in accordance with some other external reflection, has within itself the whole Notion; the Notion is the <i>omnipresent </i>soul in it, which remains simple self-relation and remains a one in the multiplicity belonging to objective being. This multiplicity, as self-external objectivity, has an indifferent subsistence, which in space and time, if these could already be mentioned here, is a mutual externality of wholly diverse and self-subsistent elements. But in life externality is at the same time present as the <i>simple determinateness </i>of its Notion; thus the soul is an omnipresent outpouring of itself into this multiplicity and at the same remains absolutely the simple oneness of the concrete Notion with itself. The thinking that clings to the determinations of the relationships of reflection and of the formal Notion, when it comes to consider life, this unity of its Notion in the externality of objectivity, in the absolute multiplicity of atomistic matter, finds all its thoughts without exception are of no avail; the omnipresence of the simple in manifold externality is for reflection an absolute contradiction, and as reflection must at the same time apprehend this omnipresence from its perception of life and therefore admit the actuality of this Idea, it is an <i>incomprehensible mystery </i>for it, because it does not grasp the Notion, and the Notion as the substance of life. This simple life, however, is not only omnipresent; it is absolutely the <i>subsistence and immanent substance </i>of its objectivity; but as subjective substance it is the <i>urge, </i>and moreover the <i>specific urge, </i>of the <i>particular </i>difference, and no less essentially the one and universal urge of the specialised difference that reduces this its particularisation into unity and maintains it therein. It is only as this <i>negative unity </i>of its objectivity and particularisation that life is a self-related life that is for itself, a soul. As such it is essentially an individual, which relates itself to objectivity as to an <i>other, </i>to a non-living nature.<br/>
<a name="HL3_764"></a>
<span class="vil">Consequently the <i>original judgment </i>of life consists in this, that it detaches itself as an individual subject from objectivity</span>, and in constituting itself the negative unity of the Notion, makes the <i>presupposition </i>of an immediate objectivity.<br/><a name="1649"></a>

Life is therefore first to be considered as a <i>living individual </i>that is for itself the subjective totality and is presupposed as indifferent to an objectivity that confronts it as indifferent.<br/><a name="1650"></a>

Secondly, it is the <i>life process, </i>the process of sublating its presupposition, positing as negative the objectivity that is indifferent to it and actualising itself as that objectivity's power and negative unity. By so doing it makes itself into the universal that is the unity of itself and its other.<br/><a name="1651"></a>

Hence life is thirdly the <i>genus process, </i>the process of sublating its individualisation and relating itself to its objective existence as to <i>itself. </i>Accordingly, this process is on the one hand the return to its Notion and the repetition of the first diremption, the becoming of a new individuality and the death of the first, immediate one; but on the other hand, the <i>Notion </i>of life that has <i>withdrawn into itself</i> is the becoming of the Notion that is in relationship with itself and exists universally and freely for itself - the transition into <i>cognition.</i><br/>
<h4 id="HGL123">A. THE LIVING INDIVIDUAL</h4>

1. The Notion of life, or universal life, is the immediate Idea, the Notion whose objectivity corresponds to it; but its objectivity corresponds to it only in so far as the Notion is the negative unity of this externality, that is to say, <i>posits </i>it as corresponding to the Notion. The infinite relation of the Notion to itself is as negativity a self-determining, the diremption of itself <i>into itself as subjective individuality and itself as indifferent universality. </i>The Idea of life in its immediacy is as yet only the creative universal soul. By reason of this immediacy, its first negative relation of the Idea within it is the self-determination of itself as <i>Notion</i> — the implicit positing that only becomes <i>explicit or for itself </i>through its return into itself — a <i>creative presupposing. </i>Through this self-determining, the <i>universal </i>life becomes a <i>particular; </i>it has thereby sundered itself into the two extremes of the judgement, which immediately becomes a syllogism.<br/><a name="HL3_765"></a>

The determinations of the opposition are the general determinations of the <i>Notion, </i>for it is the Notion which has been sundered; but the <i>filling </i>of these determinations is the Idea. One extreme is the <i>unity </i>of the Notion and reality, which is the Idea, as the <i>immediate </i>unity that at an earlier stage appeared as <i>objectivity. </i>But here it is in a different determination. There it was the unity of Notion and reality, where the Notion has passed over into the reality in which it is merely lost; it did not stand over against the reality, or in other words, because the Notion is for the reality only an inner, it is merely a reflection <i>external </i>to it. That objectivity is therefore the immediate itself in an immediate form. Here, on the contrary, it has proceeded only from the Notion, so that its essence is positedness, and it exists as a <i>negative. </i>It is to be regarded as the <i>side of the universality of the Notion, </i>consequently as <i>abstract </i>universality, essentially only <i>inhering </i>in the subject and in the form of immediate <i>being </i>which, posited on its own account, is indifferent to the subject. Thus the totality of the Notion which attaches to the objectivity is, as it were, only <i>lent </i>to it; the last self-subsistence that objectivity possesses as against the subject is this <i>being </i>which, in its truth, is only the above moment of the Notion, the Notion that, as <i>presupposing, </i>is in the first determinateness of an <i>implicit </i>positing, which does not yet exist <i>as </i>a positing, as the unity that is reflected into itself. Self-subsistent objectivity, therefore, having proceeded from the Idea, is immediate being only as the <i>predicate </i>of the judgement of the Notion's self-determination — a being that is indeed distinct from the subject, but at the same time is essentially posited as <i>moment </i>of the Notion.<br/><a name="1654"></a>

In respect of content this objectivity is the totality of the Notion; but this totality is confronted by the subjectivity or negative unity of the Notion, which constitutes the true centrality, namely the Notion's free unity with itself. This <i>subject </i>is the Idea in the form of <i>individuality, </i>as simple but negative self-identity — the <i>living individual.</i><br/><a name="1655"></a>

This is in the first place life as <i>soul, </i>as the Notion of itself that is completely determined within itself, the initiating, self-moving <i>principle. </i>The Notion in its simplicity contains determinate externality as a <i>simple </i>moment enclosed within it. But, further, this soul <i>in its immediacy </i>is immediately external and possesses an objective being of its own — a reality that is subjugated to the end, the immediate <i>means, </i>in the first instance, objectivity as <i>predicate </i>of the subject; but further, objectivity is also the <i>middle term </i>of the syllogism; the corporeality of the soul is that whereby the soul unites itself with external objectivity. The living being possesses corporeality in the first instance as reality that is immediately identical with the Notion; thus it has this corporeality in general by <i>nature.</i><br/><a name="HL3_766"></a>

Now because this objectivity is predicate of the individual and taken up into the subjective unity, the earlier determinations of the object, the mechanical or chemical relationship does not attach to it, still less the abstract relationship of reflection, of whole and parts and the like. As externality it is indeed <i>capable </i>of such relationships, but to that extent it is not a living being; when the living thing is regarded as a whole consisting of parts, or as a thing operated on by mechanical or chemical causes, as a mechanical or chemical product, whether it be regarded merely as such product or also as determined by an external end, then the Notion is regarded as external to it and it is treated as a <i>dead </i>thing. Since the Notion is immanent in it, the <i>purposiveness </i>of the living being is to be grasped as <i>inner; </i>the Notion is in it as determinate Notion, distinct from its externality, and in its distinguishing, pervading the externality and remaining identical with itself. This objectivity of the living being is the <i>organism; </i>it is the <i>means and instrument</i> of the end, perfect in its purposiveness since the Notion constitutes its substance; but for that very reason this means and instrument is itself the realised end, in which the subjective end is thus immediately brought into unity with itself. In respect of its externality the organism is a manifold, not of <i>parts </i>but of <i>members. </i>These members, as such, (a) subsist only in the individuality; in so far as they are external and can be apprehended in this externality, they are separable; but when separated, they revert to the mechanical and chemical relationships of common objectivity. (b) Their externality is opposed to the negative unity of the living individuality; the latter is therefore the <i>urge </i>to posit the abstract moment of the Notion's determinateness as a real difference; since this difference <i>is immediate, </i>it is the <i>urge </i>of each <i>single, specific moment </i>to produce itself, and equally to raise its particularity to universality, sublate the other moments external to it and produce itself at their expense, but no less to sublate itself and make itself a means for the others.<br/><a name="HL3_767"></a>

2. This <i>process </i>of the living individuality is restricted to that individuality itself and still falls entirely within it. Above, in the syllogism of external purposiveness, we considered its first premise, namely that the end relates itself immediately to objectivity and makes it a means, and we found that in this premise the end does indeed remain similar to itself and has withdrawn into itself in the objectivity, but that the objectivity has not yet <i>in its own self</i> sublated itself, and therefore the end is to that extent not yet <i>in and for itself </i>in this premise, and only becomes so in the conclusion. The process of the living being with itself is this same premise, but in so far as the latter is also conclusion, and in so far as the immediate relation of the subject to objectivity, which objectivity thereby becomes a means and instrument, is at the same time the <i>negative unity </i>of the Notion in its own self; the end realises itself in this its externality by being the subjective power over that externality and the process in which the externality displays its self-dissolution and its return into this the negative unity of the end. The restlessness and mutability of the external side of the living being is the manifestation in it of the Notion, which as in its own self negativity only has an objectivity in so far as the latter's indifferent subsistence reveals itself as self-sublating. The Notion therefore produces itself by its urge in such a manner that the product, the Notion being its essence, is itself the producing agent; that is to say the product is product only as the externality that equally posits itself as negative, or is product only in being the process of production.<br/><a name="HL3_768"></a>

3. Now the Idea just considered is the <i>Notion </i>of the <i>living subject and its process; </i>the determinations, which are in relationship with each other, are the self-related <i>negative unity </i>of the Notion <i>and objectivity</i>, which is the Notion's <i>means, </i>but in which it has <i>returned </i>into itself. But since these are moments of the Idea of life <i>within its Notion, </i>they are not the specific Notion — moments of the <i>living individual in its reality. </i>The objectivity or corporeality of this individual is a concrete totality; the above moments are the sides out of which life constitutes itself; they are therefore not the moments of this life that is already constituted by the Idea. But the living <i>objectivity </i>as such of the individual, since it is ensouled by the Notion and has the Notion for its substance, also possesses for its essential difference the determinations of the Notion, <i>universality, particularity and individuality; </i>accordingly the <i>shape [Gestalt], </i>in which they are <i>externally </i>distinguished, is divided or incised (<i>insectum</i>) on the basis of that difference.<br/><a name="1659"></a>

Thus it is in the first place <i>universality, </i>the purely internal vibration of vitality, or <i>sensibility. </i>The Notion of universality, as we have found it above, is simple immediacy, which however is this only by being within itself absolute negativity. This Notion of <i>absolute difference </i>with its negativity <i>dissolved in simplicity and</i> self-similar, is brought to view [<i>Anschaung</i>] in sensibility. It is inwardness [<i>Insichsein</i>], not as abstract simplicity but as an infinitely <i>determinable </i>receptivity, which in its <i>determinateness</i> does not become something manifold and external, but is simply reflected into itself. <i>Determinateness </i>is present in this universality as simple <i>principle; </i>the individual external determinateness, a <i>so-called impression, </i>returns from its external and manifold determination into this simplicity of <i>self-feeling. </i>Sensibility may therefore be regarded as the determinate being of the inwardly existent soul, since it receives all externality into itself, while reducing it to the perfect simplicity of self-similar universality.<br/><a name="1660"></a>

The second determination of the Notion is <i>particularity</i>, the moment of the <i>posited </i>difference, the opening up of the negativity that is locked up in simple self-feeling, or is an ideal, not yet a real, determinateness in it, that is, <i>irritability. </i>On account of the abstraction of its negativity, feeling is an urge; it <i>determines</i> itself; the self-determination of the living being is its judgement or its self-limitation [<i>Verendlichung</i>], whereby it relates itself to the external as to a <i>presupposed </i>objectivity and is in reciprocal <i>activity</i> with it. Now as a <i>particular </i>living being it is on one side a <i>species</i> alongside other species of living beings; the <i>formal </i>reflection of <i>this indifferent diversity </i>into itself is the formal <i>genus </i>and its systematisation; but the individual reflection is this, that the particularity, the negativity of its determinateness, as a direction outwards, is the self-related negativity of the Notion.<br/><a name="HL3_769"></a>

According to this third determination the living being is an <i>individual. </i>The precise determination of this reflection-into-self is such that in irritability, the living being is its own externality to itself, to the objectivity which it possesses immediately as its means and instrument, and which is externally determinable. The reflection-into-self sublates this immediacy — on the one side as a theoretical reflection, that is, in so far as the negativity is present as the simple moment of sensibility that was considered in the latter and which constitutes feeling — on the other side as real reflection, in that the unity of the Notion posits itself <i>in its external objectivity </i>as negative unity; this is <i>reproduction</i>. The first two moments, sensibility and irritability, are abstract determinations; in reproduction life is <i>concrete </i>and is vitality; in it, as in its truth, life for the first time has also feeling and the power of resistance. Reproduction is the negativity as simple moment of sensibility, and irritability is only a living power of resistance, so that the relationship to the external is reproduction and individual identity with self. Each of the individual moments is essentially the totality of all; their difference constitutes the ideal form determinateness, which is posited in reproduction as concrete totality of the whole. This whole is, therefore, on the one hand opposed as a third, namely as a <i>real </i>totality, to the former determinate totalities, while on the other hand it is their implicit essential nature, and at the same time that in which they are embraced as moments, and in which they have their subject and their subsistence.<br/><a name="1662"></a>

With reproduction as the moment of individuality, the living being posits itself as an actual individuality, a self-related being-for-self; but at the same time it is a real <i>relation outwards, the</i> reflection of <i>particularity </i>or irritability <i>towards an other, </i>towards <i>the objective </i>world. The process of life, which is enclosed within the individual, passes over into a relation to the presupposed objectivity as such, in consequence of the fact that when the individual posits itself as a <i>subjective </i>totality, the <i>moment of its determinateness </i>as a <i>relation </i>to externality becomes a <i>totality </i>as well.<br/>
<a name="HL3_769a"></a>
<h4 id="HGL124">B. THE LIFE-PROCESS</h4>

The living individual, in shaping itself inwardly, tenses itself against its original act of presupposition, and opposes itself as an absolute subject to the presupposed objective world. The subject is its own end [<i>Selbstzweck</i>], the Notion, which has its means and subjective reality in the objectivity that is subjugated to it. As such, it is constituted as the Idea in and for itself and as a being that is essentially self-subsistent, in face of which the presupposed external world has the value only of something negative and lacking self-subsistence. In its self-feeling the living being has this <i>certainty </i>of the intrinsic nullity of the <i>otherness </i>confronting it. Its urge is the need to sublate this otherness and to give itself the truth of this certainty. The individual is, as subject, in the first instance no more than the <i>Notion </i>of the Idea of life; its subjective inward process in which it draws on its own resources, and the immediate objectivity which it posits conformably to its Notion as a natural means is mediated by the process that relates itself to the completely posited externality, to the objective totality standing <i>indifferently </i>alongside it.<br/><a name="HL3_770"></a>

This process begins with <i>need, </i>that is, with a moment that is twofold. First the living being determines itself, in so doing posits itself as denied, and thereby relates itself to an <i>other </i>to it, to the indifferent objectivity; but secondly, it is equally not lost in this loss of itself but maintains itself therein and remains the identity of the self-similar Notion; thus it is the urge to posit this <i>other</i> world <i>as its own, </i>as similar to itself, to sublate it and to objectify <i>itself. </i>By doing this, its self-determination has the form of objective externality, and as it is at the same time identical with itself it is absolute <i>contradiction. </i>The immediate shape is the Idea in its simple Notion, objectivity that is conformable to the Notion; as such, it is <i>good </i>by nature. But since its negative moment realises itself as an objective particularity, that is, since each of the essential moments of its unity is realised as a separate totality, the Notion is <i>sundered </i>into an absolute disparity with itself; and since, all the same, it is absolute identity in this disharmony, the living being is for <i>itself </i>this disharmony and has the feeling of this contradiction, which is <i>pain. Pain </i>is therefore the prerogative of living natures; because they are the existent Notion, they are an actuality of infinite power such that they are within themselves the <i>negativity</i> of themselves, that this <i>their negativity is for them, </i>and that they maintain themselves in their otherness. It is said that contradiction is unthinkable; but the fact is that in the pain of a living being it is even an actual existence.<br/><a name="1665"></a>

This diremption of the living being within itself is <i>feeling</i>, the diremption being taken up into the simple universality of the Notion, into sensibility. From pain begin the <i>need </i>and the <i>urge</i> that constitute the transition by which the individual, which is explicitly the negation of itself, becomes also explicitly its own identity — an identity that exists only as the negation of the former negation. The identity that is in the urge as such is the subjective certainty of itself, in accordance with which it relates itself to its external, indifferently existing world as to an Appearance, to an intrinsically Notionless and unessential actuality. This actuality has to await the subject, which is the immanent end, before it receives the Notion into itself. The indifference of the objective world to the determinateness, and consequently to the end, constitutes its external capability of being conformable to the subject; whatever other specifications it may possess, its mechanical determinability, the absence of the freedom of the immanent Notion, constitutes its impotence to maintain itself against the living being. In so far as the object confronts the living being in the first instance as an indifferent externality, it can act upon it mechanically; but in doing so it is not acting as on a living being; where it enters into relationship with a living being it does not act on it as a cause, but <i>excites </i>it. Because the living being is an urge, externality cannot approach or enter it except in so far as it is in its own very nature already <i>in the living being; </i>therefore the action on the subject consists merely in the latter finding the externality presented to it <i>conformable. </i>This externality may not be conformable to the subject's totality, but at least it must correspond to a particular side of it, and this possibility resides simply in the fact that the subject in its external relationship is a particular.<br/><a name="HL3_771"></a>

Now the subject, as specifically related in its need to the externality, and so itself an externality or instrument, uses <i>violence </i>on the object. Its particular character, its finitude in general, falls into the more specific manifestation of this relationship. The external element in this is the process of objectivity in general, mechanism and chemism. But this process is immediately broken off and the externality transformed into internality. The external purposiveness that is produced at first by the activity of the subject in the indifferent object is sublated by reason of the fact that the object, relatively to the Notion, is not a substance, and that therefore the Notion cannot become merely the object's external form, but must posit itself as its essence and immanent pervading determination, in conformity with the Notion's original identity.<br/><a name="HL3_772"></a>

With the seizure of the object, therefore, the mechanical process passes over into the inner process by which the individual <i>appropriates </i>the object in such a manner as to deprive it of its peculiar nature [<i>Beschaffenheit</i>], convert it into a means for itself, and give its own subjectivity to it for substance. This assimilation accordingly coincides with the individual's process of reproduction considered above; in this process the individual in the first instance draws upon itself in making its own objectivity its object; the mechanical and chemical conflict of its members with external things is an objective moment of itself. The mechanical and chemical side of the process is a beginning of the dissolution of the living being. Since life is the truth of these processes, and therefore as a living being is the concrete existence of this truth and the power dominating these processes, it takes them within its embrace, pervades them as their universality, and their product is completely determined by it. This conversion of them into the living individuality constitutes the return of this latter into itself, so that production, which as such would be transition into an other, becomes reproduction, in which the living being posits itself as self-identical <i>for itself.</i><br/><a name="1668"></a>

The immediate Idea is also the immediate, not the <i>explicit,</i> identity of the Notion and reality; through the objective process the living being gives itself its feeling of <i>self; </i>for in that process it <i>posits </i>itself as what it is in and for itself, namely, as a self-identity and the negative unity of the negative in its otherness, which is posited as indifferent to it. In this coming together of the individual and its objectivity, that at first was presupposed as indifferent to it, the individual, which on one side has constituted itself an actual unity, has none the less <i>sublated its particularity </i>and raised itself <i>to universality. </i>Its particularity consisted in the diremption by which life posited as its species the individual life and the objectivity external to it. Through the external life process it has thus posited itself as real universal life, that is, as <i>genus.</i><br/>
<a name="HL3_772a"></a>
<h4 id="HGL125">C. THE GENUS</h4>

The living individual, at first disengaged from the universal Notion of life, is a presupposition that is not as yet authenticated by the living individual itself. Through its process with the simultaneously presupposed world, it has posited itself <i>on its own account </i>as the negative unity of its otherness, as the foundation of itself; as such it is the actuality of the Idea, in such a manner that now the individual brings itself forth out of <i>actuality,</i> whereas before it proceeded only from the <i>Notion, </i>and that its genesis which was an act of <i>presupposing, </i>now becomes its production.<br/><a name="1670"></a>

But the further determination that it has attained by the sublation of the opposition is that of being the <i>genus </i>as identity of itself with its previously indifferent otherness. This Idea of the individual, since it is this essential identity, is essentially the particularisation of itself. This its diremption, in accordance with the totality from which it proceeds, is the duplication of the individual — a presupposing of an objectivity that is identical with it, and a relationship of the living being to itself as to another living being.<br/><a name="1671"></a>

This universal is the third stage, the truth of life in so far as this is still confined within its sphere. This sphere is the self-related process of the individual, where externality is its immanent moment; secondly, this externality is itself, as a living totality, an objectivity that for the individual is its own self, an objectivity in which, not as <i>sublated </i>but as <i>persisting, </i>the individual has the certainty of itself.<br/><a name="1672"></a>

Now because the relationship of the genus is the identity of individual self-feeling in what is at the same time another self-subsistent individual, it is <i>contradiction; </i>thus the living being is again an <i>urge. </i>Now the genus is indeed the consummation of the Idea of life, but at first it is still within the sphere of immediacy; this universality is therefore <i>actual </i>in an <i>individual </i>shape — the Notion, whose reality has the form of immediate objectivity. Consequently, though the individual is indeed <i>in itself </i>genus, it is not <i>explicitly or for itself </i>the genus; what is <i>for </i>it is as yet only another living individual; the Notion distinguished from itself has for object, with which it is identical, not itself as Notion but a Notion that as a living being has at the same time external objectivity for it, a form that is therefore immediately reciprocal.<br/><a name="1673"></a>

The identity with the other individual, the individual's universality, is thus as yet only <i>internal or subjective; </i>it therefore has the longing to posit this and to realise itself as a universal. But this <i>urge </i>of the genus can realise itself only by sublating the single individualities which are still particular relatively to one another.<br/>
<a name="HL3_773"></a>
In that first instance, in so far as it is these latter which, <i>in themselves</i>, universal, satisfy the tension of their longing and dissolve themselves into the universality of their genus, <span class="vil">their realised end identity is the negative unity of the genus that is reflected into itself out of its disremption.</span><br>
<br/><a name="1674"></a>

It is thus the individuality of life itself, <i>generated</i> no longer from its Notion, but from the <i>actual </i>Idea. In the first instance, it is itself only Notion that has yet to objectify itself, but it is <i>the actual Notion — the germ of a living individual. </i>The germ is visible evidence to <i>ordinary perception </i>of what the Notion is, and it demonstrates that the <i>subjective Notion has external actuality. </i>For the germ of the living being is the complete concretion of individuality, in which all its diverse aspects, properties and articulated differences are contained in their <i>entire determinateness,</i> and the initially <i>immaterial, </i>subjective totality is undeveloped, simple and non-sensuous; the germ is thus the entire living being in the inner form of the Notion.<br/><a name="1675"></a>

The reflection of the genus into itself is from this side the means whereby it obtains <i>actuality, </i>the moment of negative unity and individuality being thereby posited in it — the propagation of the living species. The Idea, which as life, is still in the form of immediacy, thus falls back into actuality and this its reflection is only repetition and the infinite progress, in which it does not emerge from the finitude of its immediacy. But this return into its first Notion has also the higher side, that the Idea has not merely run through the mediation of its processes within its immediacy, but by this very act has sublated this immediacy and thereby raised itself to a higher form of its existence.<br/><a name="1676"></a>

That is to say, the process of the genus, in which the single individuals sublate in one another their indifferent immediate existence and in this negative unity expire, has further for the other side of its product the <i>realised genus, </i>which has posited itself identical with the Notion. In the genus process, the separated individualities of individual life perish; the negative identity in which the genus returns into itself, while it is on the one hand the process of <i>generating individuality, </i>is on the other hand the <i>sublating of it, </i>and is thus the genus coming together with itself, <i>the universality </i>of the Idea in process of <i>becoming for itself</i>. In copulation the immediacy of the living individuality perishes; the death of this life is the procession of spirit. The Idea, which as genus is <i>implicit, </i>is now <i>explicit, </i>in that it has sublated its particularity which constituted the living species, and has thereby given itself a <i>reality </i>that is <i>itself simple universality. </i>As such it is the Idea that <i>relates itself to itself as Idea, </i>the universal that has universality for its determinateness and existence — the Idea of <i>cognition.</i><br/>
<h3 id="HGL126">Chapter 2 The Idea of Cognition</h3>

Life is the immediate Idea, or the Idea as its <i>Notion</i> not yet realised in its own self. In its <i>judgment</i>, the Idea is <i>cognition</i> in general. <br/>

The Notion is, as Notion, <i>for itself</i> in so far as it <i>freely</i> exists as abstract universality or as genus. As such, it is its pure self-identity, which inwardly differentiates itself in such a manner that the differentiated moment is not an <i>objectivity</i>, but is likewise liberated into subjectivity or the form of simple self-likeness, and hence the object of the Notion is the Notion itself. <a name="HL3_775a"></a> <span class="vil">Its <i>reality</i> in general is the <i>form of its determinate being</i> and the point of interest is the determination this form, on this determination rests the difference between what the Notion is <i>in itself</i> or as <i>subjective</i> and what it is when submerged in objectivity, and then in the Idea of life</span>. <br/><a name="1678"></a>

In the latter it is indeed distinguished from its external reality and posited <i>for itself</i>, yet this its being-for-self it possesses only as the identity that is a relation to itself as submerged in its subjugated objectivity, or to itself as indwelling, substantial form. The elevation of the Notion above life means that its reality is the Notion form liberated into universality. Through this judgment the Idea is duplicated into the subjective Notion whose reality is the Notion itself, and into the objective Notion that is in the form of life. <i>Thinking, spirit, self-consciousness</i>, are determinations of the Idea where it has itself for object, and its determinate being, that is, the determinateness of its being, is its own difference from itself. <br/><a name="1679"></a>

The <i>metaphysics of the spirit</i>, or, as it was more commonly expressed, of the <i>soul</i> revolved round the determinations of substance, simplicity, immateriality — determinations in which the <i>general idea</i> of spirit taken from <i>empirical</i> consciousness, was laid down as subject, and it was then asked, What predicates agree with our observations? This kind of procedure could get no further than the procedure of physics, which reduces the world of phenomena to general laws and reflective determinations since it too was based on spirit merely in its <i>phenomenal</i> aspect; in fact this procedure was bound to fall short even of the scientific character of physics. Since <span class="vil">spirit is not only infinitely richer than nature, but also, its essence is constituted by the absolute unity of opposites in the <i>Notion</i></span>, it exhibits in its phenomenal aspect and relation to externality contradiction in its extreme form. Consequently, it must be possible to adduce an experience in support of each of the opposed reflective determinations, or starting from experience it must be possible to arrive at opposite determinations by way of formal syllogistic reasoning. Since the predicates immediately yielded by spirit's phenomenal aspect in the first instance still belong to empirical Psychology, there only remain, strictly speaking, for the metaphysical consideration, the wholly inadequate determinations of reflection. Kant, in his criticism of <i>rational psychology</i> adheres to this metaphysics, insisting that, in so far as rational psychology purports to be a rational science, the smallest <i>addition</i> from observation to the <i>general idea</i> of self-consciousness would transform that science into an <i>empirical</i> one and mar its rational purity and its independence of all experience. Consequently, on this view, nothing is left but the simple representation, 'I', a representation devoid of any content of its own, of which we cannot even say that it is a <i>notion</i> but a mere <i>consciousness</i> that <i>accompanies every notion</i>. <a name="HL3_776a"></a><span class="vil"> Now according to the further Kantian conclusions, by this 'I', or if you like, it (the <i>thing</i>) that thinks, nothing further is represented than a transcendental subject of thoughts</span> = x, which is cognised only through the thoughts which are its <i>predicates</i>, and of which, taken in its isolation, we can <i>never</i> have the least <i>conception</i>.<span class="vil"> In this context, the 'I' has the <i>inconvenience</i>, to use Kant's own expression that <i>we must already make use of it</i> whenever we want make any judgment about it</span>; for it is not so much a <i>single representation</i> by which a particular object is distinguished, but rather a <i>form</i> of representation in general in so far as this is to be called cognition. Now the paralogism committed by rational psychology, says Kant, consists in this, that <i>modes</i> of self-consciousness in thinking are converted into <i>notions of the understanding</i> as applied to an <i>object</i>; that the '<i>I think</i>' is taken as a <i>thinking being</i>, a <i>thing-in-itself</i>; and that in this way, from the fact that I always occur in consciousness as a <i>subject</i>, and that too as a <i>singular</i> subject, <i>identical</i> in all the multiplicity of representation, and distinguishing myself from the latter as from something external to me, the unjustified inference is drawn that the 'I' is a <i>substance</i>, and further a qualitatively <i>simple</i> being, and a one, and something that has a real existence independently of the things of time and space. <br/><a name="HL3_777"></a>

I have drawn out this exposition in some detail, because it shows clearly the nature of the previous <i>metaphysics of the soul</i> and especially, too, the nature of the <i>criticism</i> by which it was made obsolete. The former aimed at determining the <i>abstract essence</i> of the soul; in doing so, it started originally from observation and converted the empirical universality of observation and the wholly <i>external</i> reflective determination attaching to the individuality of the actual, into the form of the above-mentioned <i>determinations of essence</i>. Kant in his criticism had generally in mind only the state of the metaphysics of his time, which in the main adhered to these abstract, one-sided determinations wholly devoid of dialectic; the genuinely <i>speculative</i> ideas of older philosophers on the notion of spirit he neither heeded nor examined. <a name="HL3_777a"></a><span class="vil"> In his criticism then of those determinations, he followed quite simply Hume's style of scepticism; that is to say, he holds fast to the 'I' as it appears in self-consciousness, from which, however, since it is its essence — the <i>thing-in-itself</i> — that we are to cognise, — everything empirical must be omitted; nothing then is left but this phenomenon of the '<i>I think</i>' that accompanies every representation — of which '<i>I think</i>' we have <i>not the slightest conception</i>. </span> <br/><a name="HL3_777b"></a>
<span class="vil"> Certainly, it must be conceded that we have not the least conception the 'I', or of anything whatever, not even of the Notion itself, so long as we do not really <i>think</i>, but stop short at the simple, fixed <i>general idea</i> and the <i>name</i>. </span> It is an odd thought — if it can be called a thought at all — that I must already <i>make use</i> of the 'I' in order to judge of the 'I'; the 'I' that <i>makes use</i> of self-consciousness as a means in order to judge, this is indeed an <i>x</i> of which, as well as of the relationship of such 'making use', we cannot have the slightest conception. But surely it is ridiculous to call this nature of self-consciousness, namely, that the 'I' thinks itself, that the 'I' cannot be thought without its being the 'I' that thinks, an <i>inconvenience</i> and, as though there was a fallacy in it, a <i>circle</i>. It is this relationship through which, in immediate self-consciousness, the absolute, eternal nature of self-consciousness and the Notion itself manifests itself, and manifests itself for this reason, that self-consciousness is just the <i>existent</i> pure <i>Notion</i>, and therefore <i>empirically perceptible</i>, the absolute relation-to-self that, as a separating judgment, makes itself its own object and is solely this process whereby it makes itself a circle.  <br/><a name="HL3_778"></a> 

A stone does not have this <i>inconvenience</i>; when it is to be thought or judged it does not stand in its own way. It is relieved from the burden of making use of <i>itself</i> for this task; it is something else outside it that must give itself this trouble. <br/>


These conceptions, which must be called barbarous, place the defect in the fact that in thinking of the 'I', the 'I' as <i>subject </i>cannot be omitted; but the same defect then also appears the other way round, namely in this way, that 'I' occurs <i>only as subject of self-consciousness, </i>or I can <i>use </i>myself only as <i>subject </i>of a judgement, and the <i>intuition </i>is lacking by which the 'I' might be <i>given </i>as an <i>object; </i>but the notion of a thing that can exist only as subject does not so far involve any objective reality at all. If external intuition, determined in space and time, is required for objectivity, and it is this that is missing here, then it is quite clear that by objectivity is meant merely sensuous reality; and to have risen above <i>that </i>is a condition of thinking and of truth. But of course, if 'I' is taken not in its Notion but as a mere, simple, general idea, in the way we pronounce 'I' in everyday consciousness, then it is the abstract determination and not the self-relation that has itself for object. In that case, it is only one of the extremes, a one-sided subject without its objectivity, or else it would be merely an object without subjectivity, were it not for the inconvenience alluded to, that the thinking subject cannot be eliminated from the 'I' as object. But in fact the same inconvenience occurs with the former determination, with the 'I' as subject; the 'I' thinks <i>something, </i>itself or something else. This inseparability of the two forms in which it opposes itself to itself belongs to the innermost nature of its Notion and of the Notion itself; it is precisely what Kant wants to stave off in order to retain the mere <i>general idea, </i>which does not inwardly differentiate itself and therefore, of course, lacks the Notion. Now a Notionless conception of this kind may indeed oppose itself to the abstract reflective determinations or categories of the previous metaphysics: for in one-sidedness it stands on a level with them, though these are indeed on a higher level of thought; but on the other hand it appears all the more meagre and empty when compared with the profounder ideas of ancient philosophy on the conception of the soul or of thinking, as for example the genuinely speculative ideas of Aristotle. If the Kantian philosophy investigated the reflective categories in question, it was even more bound to investigate the firmly held abstraction of the empty 'I', the presumed idea of the thing-in-itself, which, precisely on account of its abstraction, proves on the contrary to be something completely untrue. The experience of the inconvenience complained of is itself the empirical fact in which the untruth of that abstraction expresses itself.<br/><a name="HL3_779"></a>

Mendelssohn's proof of the persistence of the soul is the only one mentioned in the Kantian critique of rational psychology, and I cite here the Kantian refutation of it on account of the remarkable nature of the argument employed to disprove it. The proof in question is based on the <i>simplicity </i>of the soul, by virtue of which it is incapable of alteration, <i>of transition into an other, </i>in time. Qualitative simplicity is in general the form of <i>abstraction</i> considered above; as <i>qualitative </i>determinateness it was investigated in the sphere of being, and it was proved that the qualitative, as such abstractly self-related determinateness, is on the contrary for that very reason dialectical, and is merely transition into an other. But in treating of the Notion it was shown that when it is considered in relation to persistence, indestructibility, imperishableness, it is the absolutely true being and the eternal, just because it is not <i>abstract</i>, but <i>concrete </i>simplicity, is determined not as abstractly self-related, but as the unity <i>of itself and its other; </i>it cannot therefore pass into that other as though it altered itself in it for the very reason that the <i>other </i>to which it is determined is the Notion itself, so that in this transition it only comes to itself. Now the Kantian criticism opposes to the said <i>qualitative </i>determination of the unity of the Notion, the <i>quantitative. </i>Although the soul is not a manifold of juxtaposed parts and contains no <i>extensive</i> magnitude, yet we are told consciousness has <i>a degree, </i>and the soul like <i>every concrete existent </i>has an <i>intensive magnitude; </i>but this postulates the possibility of transition into nothing by a <i>gradual passing away. </i>Now what is this refutation but the application to spirit of a category <i>of being</i>, of <i>intensive magnitude</i> — a determination that has no truth in itself but on the contrary is sublated in the Notion?<br/><a name="1687"></a>

Metaphysics — even the metaphysics that restricted itself to fixed concepts of the understanding and did not rise to speculative thinking, to the nature of the Notion and of the Idea — had for its aim <i>the cognition of truth, </i>and investigated its objects to ascertain whether they were true things or not, substances or phenomena.<br/><a name="HL3_780"></a>

The victory of the Kantian criticism over this metaphysics consists, on the contrary, in doing away with the investigation that has <i>truth </i>for its aim, and this aim itself; it omits altogether to raise the one question of interest, whether a particular subject, here the <i>abstract 'I' of ordinary thinking </i>possesses truth in and for itself. But to cling to phenomena and the mere conceptions given in everyday consciousness is to renounce the Notion and philosophy. Anything rising above this is stigmatised in the Kantian criticism as something high-flown to which reason is in no way entitled. As a matter of fact, the Notion does reach beyond the Notion-less, and the immediate justification for going beyond it is first, the Notion itself, and secondly, from the negative side, the untruth of phenomena and of ordinary thinking, as well as of abstractions like things-in-themselves and the above 'I', that is supposed not to be an object to itself.<br/><a name="1689"></a>

In the content of this logical exposition it is from the <i>Idea of life </i>that the Idea of spirit has issued, or what is the same thing, that the Idea of spirit has proved itself to be the truth of the Idea of life. As this result, the Idea possesses its truth in and for itself, with which one may then also compare the empirical side or the manifestation of spirit to see how far the latter accords with the former. We have seen that <i>life </i>is the Idea, but at the same time it has shown itself not to be as yet the true representation or mode of the Idea's existence. For in life, the reality of the Idea exists as <i>individuality; universality </i>or genus is the <i>inwardness; </i>the truth of life as absolute negative unity is therefore to sublate the abstract ' or what is the same, the immediate, individuality, and as <i>identical,</i> to be self-identical, as genus, to be self-similar. Now this Idea is <i>spirit. </i>In this context we may once more remark that spirit is here considered in the form that belongs to this Idea as logical. For it has other shapes as well that may be mentioned here in passing; in these it falls to be considered in the concrete sciences of spirit, namely as <i>soul, consciousness and spirit as such.</i><br/><a name="1690"></a>

The name <i>soul </i>was formerly employed for the individual finite spirit generally, and rational or empirical <i>psychology </i>was intended to be synonymous with <i>doctrine of spirit. </i>The expression “soul” evokes a mental picture of it as a <i>thing </i>like other things; one enquires as to its <i>seat, </i>the specific position in <i>space </i>from which its forces operate; still more, as to how this thing can be <i>imperishable,</i> how it can be subject to temporal conditions and yet be exempt from alteration therein. The system of <i>monads </i>exalts matter to the <i>psychical</i> [<i>Seelenhaftigkeit</i>]; in this conception the soul is an atom like the atoms of matter in general; the atom that rises as steam from the coffee cup is capable in favourable circumstances of developing into a soul; it is only the <i>greater </i>obscurity of its ideation that distinguishes it from a thing of the kind that manifests as soul.<br/><a name="HL3_781"></a>
<i>The Notion that is for itself </i>is necessarily also in <i>immediate existence; </i>in this substantial identity with life, as submerged in its externality, it is the subject matter of <i>anthropology. </i>But even anthropology must regard as alien to it the metaphysics that makes this form of <i>immediacy </i>into a <i>psychical thing, </i>into an <i>atom, </i>like the atoms of matter. To anthropology must be left only that obscure region where spirit is subjected to what were once called <i>sidereal and terrestrial </i>influences, where it lives as a natural spirit in <i>sympathy </i>with Nature and becomes aware of Nature's changes in <i>dreams and presentiments, </i>and indwells the brain, the heart, the ganglia, the liver, and so forth. According to Plato, God, mindful that even the <i>irrational </i>part of the soul should partake of his bounty and share in higher things, gave to the liver the gift of prophecy above which self-conscious man is exalted. To this irrational side belong further the conditions of ordinary thinking and higher spiritual activity in so far as this activity is subjected in the individual subject to the play of a wholly contingent physical constitution, of external influences and particular circumstances.<br/><a name="1692"></a>

This lowest of the concrete-shapes in which spirit is sunk in the material, has its immediate superior in <i>consciousness. </i>In this form the free Notion, as <i>ego that is for itself, </i>is withdrawn from objectivity, but relates itself to it as <i>its other, </i>as an object confronting it. Here spirit is no longer present as soul; on the contrary, in the <i>certainty </i>of itself, the <i>immediacy of being </i>has the significance of <i>a negative </i>for it; consequently, its identity with itself in the objectivity is at the same time still only an <i>illusory show, </i>since the objectivity, too, still has the form of an <i>implicit </i>being. This stage is the subject matter of the <i>phenomenology of spirit</i> — a science which stands midway between the science of the natural spirit and spirit as such. The phenomenology of spirit considers spirit that is <i>for itself, </i>but at the same time in its <i>relation to its other, </i>an other which, as we have recalled, is determined by that relation as both <i>implicitly </i>an object and also as negated. Thus it considers spirit in its <i>manifestation, </i>as exhibiting itself in its counterpart.<br/><a name="HL3_782"></a>

But the higher truth of this form is <i>spirit that is for itself</i>; for spirit in this form, the object that for consciousness has an <i>implicit </i>being has the form of spirit's own determination, of <i>ordinary thinking </i>as such; this <i>spirit, </i>acting on the determinations as on its own, on feelings, representations, thoughts, is thus infinite within itself and in its form. The consideration of this stage belongs to the <i>doctrine of spirit </i>proper, which would embrace what is the subject matter of ordinary <i>empirical psychology, </i>but which, to be the science of spirit, must not go empirically to work, but be scientifically conceived. Spirit is at this stage <i>finite </i>spirit, in so far as the <i>content </i>of its determinateness is an immediate, given content; the science of finite spirit has to display the process in which it liberates itself from this its determinateness and goes on to grasp the truth of itself, which is infinite spirit.<br/><a name="1694"></a>

On the other hand, the <i>Idea of spirit </i>as the subject matter of <i>logic </i>already stands within the pure science; it has not therefore to watch spirit progressing through its entanglement with nature, with immediate determinateness and material things, or with pictorial thinking; this is dealt with in the three sciences mentioned above. The Idea of spirit already has this progress behind it, or what is the same thing, still before it-the former when logic is taken as <i>the last </i>science, the latter when logic is taken as the <i>first</i> science, out of which the Idea first passes over into nature. In the logical Idea of spirit, therefore, the 'I' is immediately the free Notion, as it revealed itself to be in issuing from the Notion of nature as nature's truth, the free Notion that in its judgement is itself the object, <i>the Notion as its Idea. </i>But even in this shape the Idea is still not consummated.<br/><a name="1695"></a>

While the Idea is indeed the free Notion that has itself for object, yet it is <i>immediate, </i>and just because it is immediate it is still the Idea in its <i>subjectivity, </i>and therefore in its finitude in general. It is the end that has to realise itself, or it is the <i>absolute Idea </i>itself still in its <i>manifested </i>aspect. What it <i>seeks </i>is the <i>true, </i>this identity of the Notion itself and reality, but as yet it is only seeking it; for it is here in its <i>first </i>stage still <i>subjective. </i>Consequently though the object that is for the Notion is here also a given object, it does not enter into the subject as an object operating on it, or as an object having a constitution of its own, or as a picture thought; on the contrary, the subject converts it into <i>a determination of the Notion. </i>It is the Notion that is active in the object, relates itself to itself therein, and by giving itself its reality in the object finds <i>truth.</i><br/><a name="HL3_783"></a>

The Idea is therefore in the first instance one of the extremes of a syllogism, as the Notion that as end has initially its own self for subjective reality; the other extreme is the limitation of subjectivity, the objective world. The two extremes are identical in that they are the Idea; first their unity is that of the Notion, which in one is <i>only for itself, </i>in the other only <i>in itself; </i>secondly in one the reality is abstract, in the other it is present in its concrete actuality. This unity is now <i>posited </i>by cognition; and since this is the subjective Idea that, as end, proceeds from itself, the unity appears, at first, only as a <i>middle term. </i>The cognising subject, through the determinateness of its Notion, namely abstract being-for-self, relates itself, it is true, to an outer world, but it does so in the absolute self-certainty of itself, in order to raise its own implicit reality, this formal truth, into real truth. It possesses in its Notion the <i>entire essentiality </i>of the objective world; its process consists in positing for itself the concrete content of that world as identical with the <i>Notion, </i>and conversely, in positing the latter as identical with objectivity.<br/><a name="1697"></a>

Immediately, the Idea as manifested Idea is the <i>theoretical</i> Idea, <i>cognition </i>as such. For immediately the objective world has the form of <i>immediacy </i>or of <i>being </i>for the Notion that exists for itself; just as the latter, at first, is to itself only the abstract Notion of itself, confined within itself; it is therefore merely a <i>form; </i>its reality that it has within it is no more than its simple determinations <i>of universality and particularity, </i>while the individuality or <i>specific determinateness, </i>the content, is received by this form from outside.<br/>
<h4 id="HGL127">A.The Idea of the True</h4>
<span class="vil">The subjective Idea is in the first instance an <i>urge</i>.</span> For it is the contradiction of the Notion to have itself for <i>object</i> and to be its own reality, yet without the object being an other, that is, self-subsistent over against it, or without the difference of the Notion from itself possessing at the same time the essential determination of <i>diversity</i> and indifferent existence. <a name="HL3_783b"></a><span class="vil"> The specific nature of this urge is therefore to sublate its own subjectivity, to make its first, abstract reality into a concrete one and to fill it with the <i>content</i> of the world presupposed by its subjectivity.</span><br/><a name="HL3_784"></a>

From the other side, this urge is determined in the following manner: the Notion is, it is true, the absolute certainty of itself; but its <i>being-for-self</i> is confronted by its presupposition of a world having the form of <i>implicit</i> being, but a world whose indifferent <i>otherness</i> has for the self-certainty of the Notion the value merely of an <i>unessentiality</i>; it is thus the urge to sublate this otherness and to intuit in the object its identity with itself. This reflection-into-self is the sublated opposition, and the individuality which initially appears as the presupposed <i>implicit being</i> of a world is now <i>posited</i> as individuality and made actual for the subject; accordingly the reflection-into-self is the self-identity of the form restored out of the opposition — an identity that is therefore determined as indifferent to the form in its distinctiveness and is <i>content</i>. <br/><a name="1700"></a>

This urge is therefore the urge to <i>truth</i> in so far as truth is in <i>cognition</i>, accordingly to truth in its proper sense as <i>theoretical</i> Idea. <i>Objective</i> truth is no doubt the Idea itself as the reality that corresponds to the Notion, and to this extent an object may or may not possess truth; but, on the other hand, the more precise meaning of truth is that it is truth <i>for</i> or <i>in</i> the subjective Notion, in <i>knowing</i>. It is the relation of the Notion judgment which showed itself to be the formal judgment of truth; in it, namely, the predicate is not merely the objectivity of the Notion, but the relating comparison of the Notion of the subject-matter with its actuality. This realisation of the Notion is <i>theoretical</i> in so far as the Notion, as <i>form</i>, has still the determination of subjectivity, or has still the determination for the subject of being its own determination. <a name="HL3_784a"></a><span class="vil">Because cognition is the Idea as end as subjective, the negation of the world presupposed as an <i>implicit being</i> is the <i>first</i> negation</span>; therefore also the conclusion in which the objective is posited in the subjective, has at first only this meaning, that the <i>implicit being</i> is only <i>posited</i> in the form of subjectivity, or in the Notion determination, and for this reason is not, in that form, in and for itself. Thus the conclusion only attains to a <i>neutral unity</i> or a <i>synthesis</i>, that is, to a unity of things that are originally separate and only are externally so conjoined. Since therefore in this cognition the Notion posits the object as its <i>own</i>, the Idea in the first instance only gives itself a content whose basis is <i>given</i>, and in which only the form of externality has been sublated.  <br/><a name="HL3_785"></a>

Accordingly, this cognition still retains its <i>finitude</i> in its realised end; in its realised end it has at the same time <i>not</i> attained its end, and <i>in its truth</i> has <i>not</i> yet arrived at <i>truth</i>. For in so far as in the result the content still has the character of a <i>datum</i>, the presupposed <i>implicit being</i> confronting the Notion is not sublated; equally therefore the unity of Notion and reality, truth, is also not contained in it. <a name="HL3_785a"></a><span class="vil">Oddly enough, it is this side of <i>finitude</i> that latterly has been clung to, and accepted as the <i>absolute</i> relation of cognition — as though the finite as such was supposed to be the absolute! At this standpoint, the object is credited with being an unknown <i>thing-in-itself behind cognition</i>, and this character of the object, and with it truth too is regarded as an absolute <i>beyond</i> for cognition. In this view of cognition, thought determinations in general, the categories, reflective determinations, as well as the formal Notion and its moments are assigned the position of being finite determinations not in and for themselves, but finite in the sense that they are subjective in relation to this empty <i>thing-in-itself</i>, the fallacy of taking this untrue relation of cognition as the true relation has become the universal opinion of modern times.</span> <br/><a name="1702"></a>

From this determination of finite cognition it is immediately evident that it is a contradiction that sublates itself — the contradiction of a truth that at the same time is supposed not to be truth — of a cognition of what <i>is</i>, which at the same time does not cognise the thing-in-itself. In the collapse of this contradiction, its content, subjective cognition and the thing-in-itself, collapses, that is, proves itself an untruth. <a name="HL3_785b"></a><span class="vil"> But cognition must, in the course of its own movement, resolve its finitude and with it its contradiction</span>; this examination of it made by us is an external reflection; but cognition is itself the Notion, the Notion that is its own end and therefore through its realisation fulfils itself, and in this very fulfilment sublates its subjectivity and the presupposed implicit being. We have therefore to consider cognition in its own self in its positive activity. Since this Idea is, as we have seen, the urge of the Notion to realise itself <i>for itself</i>, its activity consists in determining the object, and by this determining to relate itself in the object identically to itself. The object is in general something simply determinable, and in the Idea it has this essential side of not being in and for itself opposed to the Notion. Because cognition is still finite, not speculative, cognition, the presupposed objectivity has not as yet for it the shape of something that is in its own self simply and solely the Notion and that contains nothing with a particularity of its own as against the latter. <br/><a name="HL3_786"></a> 

But the fact that it counts as an implicit beyond, necessarily implies that its <i>determinability by the Notion</i> is a determination it possesses essentially; for <i>the Idea</i> is the Notion that exists for itself, is that which is absolutely infinite within itself, in which the object is <i>implicitly</i> sublated and the end is now solely to sublate it <i>explicitly</i>. Hence, though the object is presupposed by the Idea of cognition as possessing an <i>implicit being</i>, yet it is essentially in a relationship where the Idea, certain of itself and of the nullity of this opposition, comes to the realisation of its Notion in the object.<br/><a name="1704"></a>

In the syllogism whereby the subjective Idea now unites itself with objectivity, the <i>first premise</i> is the same form of immediate seizure and relation of the Notion to the object that we saw in the relation of end. The determining activity of the Notion upon the object is an immediate <i>communication</i> of itself to the object and unresisted <i>pervasion</i> of the latter by the Notion. In this process the Notion remains in pure identity with itself; but this its immediate reflection-into-self has equally the determination of objective immediacy; that which <i>for the Notion</i> is its own determination, is equally a <i>being</i>, for it is the <i>first</i> negation of the presupposition. Therefore the posited determination ranks just as much as a presupposition that has been merely <i>found</i>, as an <i>apprehension</i> of a <i>datum</i>; in fact the activity of the Notion here consists merely in being negative towards itself, restraining itself and making itself passive towards what confronts it, in order that the latter may be able to <i>show</i> itself, not as determined by the subject, but as it is in its own self.<br/><a name="1705"></a>

Accordingly in this premise this cognition does not appear even as an <i>application</i> of logical determinations, but as an acceptance and apprehension of them just as given, and its activity appears to be restricted merely to the removal of a subjective obstacle, an external husk, from the subject-matter. This cognition is <i>analytic</i> cognition. <br/>
<a name="HL3_786a"></a>
<h5 id="HGL128">(a) Analytic Cognition</h5>

We sometimes find the difference between analytic and synthetic cognition stated in the form that one proceeds from the known to the unknown, the other from the unknown to the known. But if this distinction is closely examined, it will be difficult to discover in it a definite thought, much less a Notion. <br/><a name="HL3_787"></a>

It may be said that cognition begins in general with ignorance, for one does not learn to know something with which one is already acquainted. Conversely, it also begins with the known; this is a tautological proposition; that with which it begins, which therefore it actually cognises, is <i>ipso facto</i> something known; what is not as yet known and is to be known only later is still an unknown. So far, then, it must be said that cognition, once it has begun, always proceeds from the known to the unknown.<br/><a name="1708"></a>

The distinguishing feature of analytic cognition is already defined in the fact that as the first premise of the whole syllogism, analytic cognition does not as yet contain mediation; it is the immediate communication of the Notion and does not as yet contain otherness, and in it the activity empties itself of its negativity. However, this immediacy of the relation is for that reason itself a mediation, for it is the negative relation of the Notion to the object, but a relation that annuls itself, thereby making itself simple and identical. This reflection-into-self is only subjective, because in its mediation the difference is present still only in the form of the presupposed <i>implicit</i> difference, as difference <i>of the object</i> within itself. The determination, therefore, brought about by this relation, is the form of simple <i>identity</i>, of <i>abstract universality</i>. Accordingly, analytic cognition has in general this identity for its principle; and transition into an other, the connection of different terms, is excluded from itself and from its activity.<br/><a name="1709"></a>

If we look now more closely at analytic cognition, we see that it starts from a <i>presupposed</i>, and therefore individual, <i>concrete</i> subject matter; this may be an object already <i>complete in itself</i> for ordinary thought, or it may be a <i>problem</i>, that is to say, given only in its circumstances and conditions, but not yet disengaged from them and presented on its own account in simple self-subsistence. Now the analysis of this subject matter cannot consist in its being merely <i>resolved</i> into the particular <i>picture thoughts</i> which it may contain; such a resolution and the apprehension of such picture thoughts is a business that would not belong to cognition, but would merely be a matter of a closer <i>acquaintance</i>, a determination within the sphere of <i>picture-thinking</i>. Since analysis is based on the Notion, its products are essentially Notion-determinations, and that too as determinations <i>immediately contained</i> in the subject matter.<br/><a name="HL3_788"></a> 

We have seen from the nature of the Idea of cognition, that the activity of the subjective Notion must be regarded from one side merely as the <i>explication</i> of <i>what is already in the object</i>, because the object itself is nothing but the totality of the Notion. <a name="HL3_788a"></a><span class="vil"> It is just as one-sided to represent analysis as though there were nothing in the subject matter that was not <i>imported</i> into it, as it is one-sided to suppose that the resulting determinations are merely <i>extracted</i> from it. The former view, as everyone knows, is enunciated by subjective idealism, which takes the activity of cognition in analysis to be merely a one-sided <i>positing</i>, beyond which the <i>thing-in-itself</i> remains concealed; the other view belongs to so-called realism which apprehends the subjective Notion as an empty Identity that <i>receives</i> the thought determinations into itself from <i>outside</i>. </span> Analytic cognition, the transformation of the given material into logical determinations, has shown itself to be two things in one: a <i>positing</i> that no less immediately determines itself as a <i>presupposing</i>. Consequently, by virtue of the latter, the logical element may appear as something <i>already complete</i> in the object, just as by virtue of the former it may appear as the <i>product</i> of a merely subjective activity. <a name="HL3_788b"></a> <span class="vil">But the two moments are not to be separated; the logical element in its abstract form into which analysis raises it, is of course only to be found in cognition, while conversely it is something not merely <i>posited</i>, but possessing <i>being in itself</i></span>.  <br/><a name="1711"></a>

Now since analytic cognition is the transformation indicated above, it does not pass through any further <i>middle term</i>; the determination is in so far <i>immediate</i> and has just this meaning, to be peculiar to the object and in itself to belong to it, and therefore to be apprehended from it without any subjective mediation. But further, cognition is supposed also to be a <i>progress</i>, an <i>explication of differences</i>. But because, in accordance with the determination it has here, it is Notion-less and undialectical, it possesses only a <i>given difference</i>, and its progress takes place solely in the determinations of the <i>material</i>. It seems to have an <i>immanent</i> progress only in so far as the derived thought determinations can be analysed afresh, in so far as they are a concrete; the highest and ultimate point of this process of analysis is the abstract highest essence, or abstract subjective identity — and over against it, diversity. <br/><a name="1712"></a>
<a name="HL3_789"></a> This progress is, however, nothing but the mere repetition of the one original act of analysis, namely, the fresh determination as a <i>concrete</i>, of what has already been taken up into the abstract form of the Notion; this is followed by the analysis of it, then by the determination afresh as a concrete of the abstract that emerges from it, and so forth. But the thought determinations seem also to contain a transition within themselves. If the object is determined as a whole, then of course one advances from this to the <i>other</i> determination of <i>part</i>, from <i>cause</i> to the other determination of <i>effect</i>, and so on. But here this is no advance, since whole and part, cause and effect, are <i>relationships</i> and moreover, for this formal cognition, relationships <i>complete in themselves</i> such that in them one determination is <i>already found</i> essentially linked to the other. The subject matter that has been determined as <i>cause</i> or as <i>part</i> is <i>ipso facto</i> determined by the <i>whole</i> relationship, that is, determined already by both sides of it. Although the relationship is <i>in itself</i> something synthetic, yet for analytic cognition this connection is as much a mere <i>datum</i> as any other connection of its material and therefore is not relevant to its own peculiar business. Whether a connection of this kind be otherwise determined as <i>a priori</i> or <i>a posteriori</i> is here a matter of indifference, for it is apprehended as something <i>found already there</i>, or, as it has also been described, as a <i>fact</i> of consciousness that with the determination <i>whole</i> is linked the determination <i>part</i>, and so forth. <a name="HL3_789a"></a> While Kant has made the profound observation that there are synthetic <i>a priori</i> principles and has recognised their root in the unity of self-consciousness and therefore in the identity of the Notion with itself, yet <span class="vil">he adopts the <i>specific</i> connection, the concepts of relation and the synthetic principles themselves <i>from formal logic</i> as <i>given</i>; their justification should have been the exposition of the transition of that simple unity of self-consciousness into these its determinations and distinctions, but Kant spared himself the trouble of demonstrating this genuinely synthetic progress — the self-producing Notion.</span> <br/>



It is a familiar fact that <i>arithmetic</i> and the more general <i>sciences of discrete magnitude</i> especially, are called <i>analytical science</i> and <i>analysis</i>. As a matter of fact, their method of cognition is immanently analytical in the highest degree and we shall briefly consider the basis of this fact. All other analytic cognition starts from a concrete material that in itself possesses a contingent manifoldness; on this material depends all distinction of content and progress to a further content.<br/><a name="HL3_790"></a>

The material of arithmetic and algebra, on the other hand, is something that has already been made wholly abstract and indeterminate and purged of all peculiarity of relationship, and to which, therefore, every determination and connection is something external. Such a material is the principle of discrete magnitude, the <i>one. </i>This relationless atom can be increased to a <i>plurality, </i>and externally determined and unified into a sum; this process of increasing and delimiting is an empty progression and determining that never gets beyond the same principle of the abstract one. How <i>numbers </i>are further combined and separated depends solely on the positing activity of the cognising subject. <i>Magnitude </i>is in general the category within which these determinations are made; it is the determinateness that has become an <i>indifferent </i>determinateness, so that the subject matter has no determinateness that might be immanent in it and therefore a <i>datum </i>for cognition. Cognition having first provided itself with a contingent variety of numbers, these now constitute the material for further elaboration and manifold relationships. Such relationships, their discovery and elaboration, do not seem, it is true, to be anything immanent in analytic cognition, but something contingent and given; and these relationships and the operations connected with them, too, are usually presented <i>successively as different </i>without any observation of an inner connection. Yet it is easy to discover a guiding principle, and that is the immanent principle of analytic identity, which appears in the diverse as <i>equality; </i>progress consists in the reduction of the unequal to an ever greater equality. To give an example in the first elements, addition is the combining of quite contingently unequal numbers, multiplication, on the contrary, the combination <i>of equal</i> numbers; these again are followed by the relationship of <i>the equality of amount and unity, </i>and the relationship of powers makes its appearance.<br/><a name="HL3_790a"></a>

Now because the determinateness of the subject matter and of the relationships is a <i>posited </i>one, the further operation with them is also wholly analytic, and the science of analysis possesses not so much <i>theorems as problems. </i>The analytical theorem contains the problem as already solved for it, and the altogether external difference attaching to the two sides equated by the theorem is so unessential that a theorem of this kind would appear as a trivial identity. Kant, it is true, has declared the proposition 5 + 7 = 12, to be a <i>synthetic </i>proposition, because the same thing is presented on one side in the form of a plurality, 5 and 7, and on the other side in the form of a unity, 12. But if the analytic proposition is not to mean the completely abstract identity and tautology 12 = 12 and is to contain any advance at all, it must present a difference of some kind, though a difference not based on any quality, on any determinateness of reflection, and still less of the Notion. 5 + 7 and 12 are out and out the same content; the first side also expresses the <i>demand that </i>5 and 7 shall be combined in one expression; that is to say, that just as 5 is the result of a counting up in which the counting was quite arbitrarily broken off and could just as well have been continued, so now, in the same way, the counting is to be continued with the condition that the ones to be added shall be seven. The 12 is therefore a result of 5 and 7 and of an operation which is already posited and in its nature is an act completely external and devoid of any thought, so that it can be performed even by a machine. Here there is not the slightest trace of a transition to an <i>other; </i>it is a mere continuation, that is, <i>repetition, </i>of the same operation that produced 5 and 7.<br/><a name="HL3_791"></a>

The <i>proof </i>of a theorem of this kind — and it would require a proof if it were a synthetic proposition — would consist merely in the operation of counting on from 5 for a further 7 ones and in discerning the agreement of the result of this counting with what is otherwise called 12, and which again is nothing else but just that process of counting up to a defined limit. Instead, therefore, of the form of theorem, the form of <i>problem </i>is directly chosen, the <i>demand </i>for the operation, that is to say, the expression of only <i>one</i> side of the equation that would constitute the theorem and whose other side is now to be found. The problem contains the content and states the specific operation that is to be undertaken with it. The operation is not restricted by any unyielding material endowed with specific relationships, but is an external subjective act, whose determinations are accepted with indifference by the material in which they are posited. The entire difference between the conditions laid down in the problem and the result in the <i>solution, is</i> merely that the specific mode of union or separation indicated in the former is <i>actual </i>in the latter.<br/><a name="HL3_792"></a>

It is, therefore, an utterly superfluous bit of scaffolding to apply to these cases the form of geometrical method, which is relevant to synthetic propositions and to add to the <i>solution </i>of the problem a <i>proof </i>as well. The proof can express nothing but the tautology that the solution is correct because the operation set in the problem has been performed. If the problem is to add several numbers, then the solution is to add them; the proof shows that the solution is correct because the problem was to add, and addition has been carried out. If the problem contains more complex expressions and operations, say for instance, to multiply decimal numbers, and the solution indicates merely the mechanical procedure, a proof does indeed become necessary; but this proof can be nothing else but the analysis of those expressions and of the operation from which the solution proceeds of itself. By this separation of the <i>solution </i>as a mechanical procedure, and of the <i>proof </i>as a reference back to the nature of the subject matter to be treated, we lose what is precisely the advantage of the analytical problem, namely that <i>the construction </i>can be immediately deduced from the problem and can therefore be exhibited as <i>intelligible </i>in and for itself; put the other way, the construction is expressly given a defect peculiar to the synthetic method. In the higher analysis, where with the relationship of powers, we are dealing especially with relationships of discrete magnitude that are qualitative and dependent on Notion determinatenesses, the problems and theorems do of course contain synthetic expressions; there other expressions and relationships must be taken as intermediate terms besides those <i>immediately specified </i>by the problem or theorem. And, we may add, even these auxiliary terms must be of a kind to be grounded in the consideration and development of some side of the problem or theorem; the synthetic appearance comes solely from the fact that the problem or theorem does not itself already name this side. The problem, for example, of finding the sum of the powers of the roots of an equation is solved by the examination and subsequent connection of the functions which the coefficients of the equation are of the roots. The determination employed in the solution, namely, the functions of the coefficients and their connection, is not already expressed in the problem-for the rest, the development itself is wholly analytical. The same is true of the solution of the equation <i>x</i><sup>(<i>m</i>-1)</sup> - 1 = 0 with the help of the sine, and also of the immanent algebraic solution, discovered, as is well known, by Gauss, which takes into consideration the <i>residuum </i>of <i>x</i><sup>(<i>m</i>-1)</sup> - 1 divided by <i>m</i>, and the so-called primitive roots — one of the most important extensions of analysis in modern times. These solutions are synthetic because the terms employed to help, the sine or the consideration of the residua, are not terms of the problem itself.<br/><a name="HL3_793"></a>

The nature of the analysis that considers the so-called infinitesimal differences of variable magnitudes, the analysis of the differential and integral calculus, has been treated in greater detail in the <i>first</i> part of this <i>logic</i>. It was there shown that there is here an underlying qualitative determination of magnitude which can be grasped only by means of the Notion. The transition to it from magnitude as such is no longer analytic; and therefore <span class="vil">mathematics to this day has never succeeded in justifying by its own means, that is, mathematically, the operations that rest on that transition, because the transition is not of a mathematical nature. Leibnitz, who is given the credit of having reduced calculation with infinitesimal differences to a <i>calculus</i>, has, as was mentioned in the same place, made the transition in the most inadequate manner possible, a manner that is as completely unphilosophical as it is unmathematical</span>; but once the transition is presupposed — and in the present state of the science it is no more than a presupposition — the further course is certainly only a series of ordinary operations.<br/><a name="HL3_793a"></a>

It has been remarked that analysis becomes synthetic when it comes to deal with <i>determinations</i> that are no longer <i>posited</i> by the problems themselves. But the general transition from analytic to synthetic cognition lies in the necessary transition from the form of immediacy to mediation, from abstract identity to difference. Analytic cognition in its activity does not in general go beyond determinations that are self-related; but by virtue of their <i>determinateness</i> they are also essentially of such a nature that they <i>relate themselves to an other</i>. It has already been remarked that even when analytic cognition goes on to deal with relationships that are not externally give material but thought determinations, it still remains analytic, since for it even these relationships are <i>given</i> ones. But becase abstract identity, which alone analytic cognition knows as its own, is essentially the <i>identity of distinct terms</i>, identity in this form too must belong to cognition and become for the subjective Notion also the <i>connection</i> that is posited by it and identical with it.<br/>
<a name="HL3_794"></a>
<h5 id="HGL129">(b) Synthetic Cognition</h5>
<span class="vil">Analytic cognition is the first premise of the whole syllogism — the <i>immediate</i> relation of the Notion to the object; <i>identity</i>, therefore, is the determination which it recognises as its own, and analytic cognition is merely the <i>apprehension</i> of what <i>is</i>. Synthetic cognition aims at the <i>comprehension</i> of what <i>is</i>, that is, at grasping the multiplicity of determinations in their unity. It is therefore the second premise of the syllogism in which the <i>diverse</i> as such is related. Hence its aim is in general <i>necessity</i></span>. The different terms which are connected, are on the one hand connected in a <i>relation</i>; in this relation they are related and at the same time mutually indifferent and self-subsistent, but on the other hand, they are linked together in the <i>Notion </i>which is their simple yet determinate unity. Now synthetic cognition passes over, in the first instance, <i>from abstract identity to relation, </i>or from <i>being to reflection, </i>and so far it is not the absolute reflection of the Notion that the Notion cognises in its subject matter. The reality it gives itself is the next stage, namely, the stated identity of the different terms as such, an identity therefore that is at the same time still <i>inner </i>and only necessity, not the subjective identity that is <i>for itself; </i>hence not yet the Notion as such. Synthetic cognition, therefore, has indeed the Notion determinations for its content, and the object is posited in them; but they only stand in <i>relation </i>to one another, or are in <i>immediate </i>unity, and just for that reason, not in the unity by which the Notion exists as subject.<br/><a name="1721"></a>

This constitutes the finitude of this cognition; because this real side of the Idea in it still possesses identity as an inner identity, its determinations are to themselves still <i>external; </i>because the identity is not in the form of subjectivity, the Notion's own pervasion of the object still lacks <i>individuality; </i>what corresponds to the Notion in the object is indeed no longer the abstract but the <i>determinate form</i> and therefore the <i>particularity </i>of the Notion, but the <i>individual</i> element in the object is still <i>a given </i>content. Consequently, although this cognition transforms the objective world into Notions, it gives it Notion-determinations only in respect of form, and must find the object in respect of its <i>individuality, </i>its specific determinateness; such cognition is not yet self-determining. Similarly, it finds propositions and laws, and proves their <i>necessity,</i> but not as a necessity of the subject matter in and for itself, that is, not from the Notion, but as a necessity of the cognition that works on given determinations, on the differences of the phenomenal aspect of the subject matter, and cognises <i>for itself </i>the proposition as a unity and relationship, or cognises the ground of phenomena from the <i>phenomena </i>themselves.<br/>
<a name="HL3_795"></a>
We have now to consider the detailed moments of synthetic cognition.<br/>
<h6 id="HGL1210">1. Definition</h6>

First, the still given objectivity is transformed into the simple and first form, hence into the form of the <i>Notion. </i>Accordingly the moments of this apprehension are none other than the moments of the Notion, <i>universality, particularity and individuality. The individual </i>is the object itself as an <i>immediate representation</i>, that which is to be defined. The universality of the object of definition we have found in the determination of the objective judgment or judgment of necessity to be the <i>genus, </i>and indeed the <i>proximate</i> genus; that is to say, the universal with this determinateness that is at the same time a principle for the differentiation of the particular. This difference the object possesses in the <i>specific difference, </i>which makes it the determinate species it is and is the basis of its disjunction from the remaining species.<br/><a name="1723"></a>

Definition, in thus reducing the subject matter to its <i>Notion,</i> strips it of its externalities which are requisite for its concrete existence; it abstracts from what accrues to the Notion in its realisation, whereby it emerges first into Idea, and secondly into external existence. <i>Description </i>is for <i>representation, </i>and takes in this further content that belongs to reality. But definition reduces this wealth of the manifold determinations of intuited existence to the simplest moments; the form of these simple elements, and how they are determined relatively to one another, is contained in the Notion. The subject matter is thus, as we have stated, grasped as a universal that is at the same time essentially determinate. The subject matter itself is the third factor, the individual, in which the genus and the particularisation are posited in one; it is an <i>immediate </i>that is posited <i>outside </i>the Notion, since the latter is not yet self-determining.<br/><a name="1724"></a>

In the said moments, which are the form-difference of definition, the Notion finds itself and has in them the reality correspondent to it. But the reflection of the Notion-moments into themselves, which is individuality, is not yet contained in this reality, and therefore the object, in so far as it is in cognition, is not yet determined as subjective. Whereas, cognition on the contrary is subjective and has an external starting point, or it is subjective by reason of its external starting point in the individual. The content of the Notion is therefore a <i>datum </i>and contingent. Consequently, the concrete Notion itself is contingent in a twofold aspect: first it is contingent in respect of its content as such; secondly it is contingent which determinations of the content from among the manifold qualities that the object possesses in external existence are to be selected for the Notion and are to constitute its moments.<br/><a name="HL3_796"></a>

The latter point requires closer consideration. For since individuality, which is determined in and for itself, lies outside the Notion-determination peculiar to synthetic cognition there is no principle available for determining which sides of the subject matter are to be regarded as belonging to its Notion-determination and which merely to the external reality. This constitutes a difficulty in the case of definitions, a difficulty that for synthetic cognition cannot be overcome. Yet here a distinction must be made. In the first place, the definition of products of self-conscious purposiveness is easily discovered; for the end that they are to serve is a determination created out of the subjective resolve and constituting the essential particularisation, the form of the concrete existent thing, which is here the sole concern. Apart from this, the nature of its material and its other external properties, in so far as they correspond to the end, are contained in its determination; the rest are unessential for it.<br/><a name="1726"></a>

Secondly, geometrical objects are abstract determinations of space; the underlying abstraction, so-called absolute space, has lost all further concrete determinations and now too possesses only such shapes and configurations as are posited in it. These objects therefore are only what they are <i>meant </i>to be; their Notion determination in general, and more precisely the specific difference, possesses in them its simple unhindered reality. To this extent, they resemble the products of external purposiveness, and they also agree with the subject matter of arithmetic in which likewise the underlying determination is only that which has been posited in it. True, space has still further determinations: its <i>three-dimensionality, </i>its continuity and divisibility, which are not first posited in it by external determination. But these belong to the accepted material and are immediate presuppositions; it is only the combination and entanglement of the former subjective determinations with this peculiar nature of the domain into which they have been imported that produces synthetic relationships and laws. In the case of numerical determinations, since they are based on the simple principle of the One, their combination and any further determination is simply and solely a positedness; on the other hand, determinations in space, which is explicitly a continuous <i>mutual externality, </i>run a further course of their own and possess a reality distinct from their Notion; but this no longer belongs to the immediate definition.<br/><a name="HL3_797"></a>

But, thirdly, in the case of definitions of <i>concrete </i>objects of Nature as well as of spirit, the position is quite different. In general such objects are, for representation, <i>things of many properties. </i>Here, what we have to do in the first instance is to apprehend what is their proximate genus, and then, what is their specific difference. We have therefore to determine which of the many properties belong to the object as genus, and which as species, and further which among these properties is the essential one; this last point involves the necessity of ascertaining their interrelationship, whether one is already posited with the other. But for this purpose there is so far no other criterion to hand than <i>existence </i>itself. The essentiality of the property for the purpose of the definition, in which it is to be posited as a simple, undeveloped determinateness, is its universality. But in existence universality is merely empirical. It may be universality in time - whether the property in question is lasting, while the others show themselves transitory in the subsistence of the whole; or it may be a universality resulting from comparison with other concrete wholes and in that case it goes no further than community. Now if comparison indicates as the common basis the total <i>habitus </i>as empirically presented, reflection has to bring this together into a simple thought determination and to grasp the simple character of such a totality. But the only possible attestation that a thought determination, or a single one of the immediate properties, constitutes the simple and specific essence of the object, is the <i>derivation </i>of such a determination from the concrete properties of the subject matter. But this would demand an analysis transforming the immediate properties into thoughts and reducing what is concrete to something simple. Such an analysis, however, would be higher than the one already considered; for it could not be abstractive, but would have to preserve in the universal what is specific in the concrete, unify it and show it to be dependent on the simple thought determination.<br/><a name="HL3_798"></a>

The relations of the manifold determinations of immediate existence to the simple Notion would however be theorems requiring proof. But definition is the first, still undeveloped Notion; therefore, when it has to apprehend the simple determinateness of the subject matter, which apprehension has to be something immediate, it can only employ for the purpose one of <i>its immediate </i>so-called properties - a determination of sensuous existence or representation. The isolation, then, of this property by abstraction, constitutes simplicity, and for universality and essentiality the Notion has to fall back onto empirical universality, the persistence in altered circumstances, and the reflection that seeks the Notion-determination in external existence and in picture thinking, that is, seeks it where it is not to be found. Definition, therefore, automatically renounces the Notion-determinations proper, which would be essentially principles of the subject matter, and contents itself with <i>marks, </i>that is, determinations in <i>which essentiality </i>for the object itself is a matter of indifference, and which are intended merely to be <i>distinguishing </i>marks for an external reflection. A single, external determinateness of this kind is too inadequate to the concrete totality and to the nature of its Notion, to justify its selection for its own sake, nor could it be taken for the true expression and determination of a concrete whole. According to Blumenbach's observation, for example, the lobe of the ear is absent in all other animals, and therefore in the usual phraseology of common and distinguishing marks it could quite properly be used as the distinctive characteristic in the definition of physical man. But how inadequate such a completely external determination at once appears when compared with the conception of the total <i>habitus </i>of physical man, and with the demand that the Notion determination shall be something essential! It is quite contingent whether the marks adopted in the definition are pure makeshifts like this, or on the other hand approximate more to the nature of a principle. It is also to be observed that, on account of their externality, they have not been the starting point in the cognition of the Notion of the object; on the contrary, an obscure feeling, an indefinite but deeper sense, an inkling of what is essential, has preceded the discovery of the genera in nature and in spirit, and only afterwards has a specific externality been sought to satisfy the understanding. In existence the Notion has entered into externality and is accordingly explicated into its differences and cannot be attached simply to a single one of such properties. The properties, as the externality of the thing, are external to themselves; that is why, as we pointed out in the sphere of Appearance when dealing with the thing of many properties, properties essentially become even self-subsistent matters; spirit, regarded from the same standpoint of Appearance, becomes an aggregate of a number of self-subsistent forces. Through this standpoint, the single property or force, even where it is posited as indifferent to the others, ceases to be a characterising principle, with the result that the determinateness, as determinateness of the Notion, vanishes altogether.<br/><a name="HL3_799"></a>

Into concrete things, along with the diversity of the properties among themselves, there enters also the difference between the <i>Notion </i>and its <i>actualisation. </i>The Notion in nature and in spirit has an external presentation in which its determinateness shows itself as dependence on the external, as transitoriness and inadequacy. Therefore, although any actual thing no doubt shows in itself what it <i>ought </i>to be, yet in accordance with the negative judgment of the Notion it may equally show that its actuality only imperfectly corresponds to this Notion, that it is <i>bad. </i>Now the definition is supposed to indicate the determinateness of the Notion in an immediate property; yet there is no property against which an instance cannot be brought in which the total habitus, though it enables one to discern the concrete thing to be defined, yet the property taken as its characteristic shows itself immature or stunted. In a bad plant, a poor specimen of an animal, a contemptible human being, a bad state, aspects of its concrete existence are defective or entirely obliterated that otherwise might have been adopted for the definition as the distinguishing mark and essential determinateness in the existence of such a concrete. But for all that, a bad plant or a bad animal, etc., still remains a plant or an animal. If, therefore, bad specimens too are to be covered by the definition, then all the properties that we wanted to regard as essential elude us through instances of malformations in which those properties are lacking. Thus for example the essentiality of the brain for physical man is contradicted by the instance of acephalous individuals, the essentiality of the protection of life and property for the state, by the instance of despotic states and tyrannous governments. If the Notion is asserted against such an instance and the instance, being measured by the Notion, is declared to be a bad specimen, then the Notion is no longer attested by phenomena. But the self-subsistence of the Notion is contrary to the meaning of definition; for definition is supposed to be the <i>immediate </i>Notion, and therefore can only draw on the immediacy of existence for its determinations for objects, and can justify itself only in what it finds already to hand. Whether its content is <i>in-and-for itself </i>truth or a contingency, this lies outside its sphere; but formal truth, the agreement between the Notion subjectively posited in the definition and an actual object outside it, cannot be established because the individual object may also be a bad specimen.<br/><a name="1730"></a>

The content of definition is in general taken from immediate existence, and being an immediate content has no justification; the question of its necessity is precluded by its origin; in enunciating the Notion as a mere immediate, the definition refrains from comprehending the Notion itself. Hence it represents nothing but the form determination of the Notion in a given content, without the reflection of the Notion into itself, that is, <i>without the Notion's being-for-self.</i><br/><a name="1731"></a>

But immediacy in general proceeds only from mediation, and must therefore pass over into mediation. Or, in other words, the determinateness of the content contained in the definition, because it is determinateness, is not merely an immediate, but is mediated by its opposite; consequently definition can apprehend its subject matter only through the opposite determination and must therefore pass over into <i>division.</i><br/>
<h6 id="HGL1211">2. Division</h6>

The universal must <i>particularise</i> itself; so far, the necessity for division lies in the universal. But since definition itself already begins with the particular, its necessity for passing over into division lies in the particular, that by itself points to another particular. Conversely, it is precisely in the act of holding fast to the determinateness in the need to distinguish it from its other, that the particular separates itself off from the universal; consequently the universal is <i>presupposed</i> for division. The procedure is, therefore, that the individual content of cognition ascends through particularity to the extreme of universality; but now the latter must be regarded as the objective basis, and with this as the starting point, division presents itself as disjunction of the universal as the <i>prius</i>.<a name="HL3_801"></a>
<p>
This has introduced a transition which, since it takes place from the universal to the particular, is determined by the form of the Notion. Definition by itself is something individual; a plurality of definitions goes with the plurality of objects. The progress, proper to the Notion, from universal to particular, is the basis and the possibility of a <i>synthetic science</i>, of a <i>system</i> and of <i>systematic cognition</i>.<a name="1734"></a>
<p>
The first requisite for this is, as we have shown, that the beginning be made with the subject matter in the form of a <i>universal</i>. In the sphere of actuality, whether of nature or spirit, it is the concrete individuality that is given to subjective, natural cognition as the <i>prius</i>; but in cognition that is a <i>comprehension</i>, at least to the extent that it has the form of the Notion for basis, the <i>prius</i> must be on the contrary something <i>simple</i>, something <i>abstracted</i> from the concrete, because in this form alone has the subject-matter the form of the self-related universal or of an immediate based on the Notion.<br/><a name="1735"></a>

It might perhaps be objected to this procedure in the scientific sphere that, because intuition is easier than cognition, the object of intuition, that is, concrete actuality, should be made the beginning of science, and that this procedure is more <i>natural</i> than that which proceeds in the opposite direction to its particularisation and concrete individualisation. But the fact that the aim is <i>to cognise</i>, implies that the question of a comparison with <i>intuition</i> is already settled and done with; there can only be a question of what is to be the first and what is to be the nature of the sequel <i>within the process of cognition</i>; it is no longer a <i>natural</i> method, but a method appropriate to <i>cognition</i> that is demanded. If it is merely a question of <i>easiness</i>, then it is self-evident besides, that it is easier for cognition to grasp the abstract simple thought determination than the concrete subject matter, which is a manifold connection of such thought determinations and their relationships; and it is in this manner that we have now to apprehend the concrete, and not as it is in intuition. The <i>universal</i> is in and for itself the first moment of the Notion because it is the <i>simple</i> moment, and the particular is only subsequent to it because it is the mediated moment; and conversely the <i>simple</i> is the more universal, and the concrete, as in itself differentiated and so mediated, is that which already presupposes the transition from a first. This remark applies not only to the order of procedure in the specific forms of definitions, divisions, and propositions, but also to the order of cognition as a whole and simply with respect to the difference of abstract and concrete in general. Hence in learning to read, for example, the rational way is not to begin with reading of whole words or even syllables, but with <i>elements</i> of the words and syllables, and the signs of <i>abstract</i> sounds: in written characters, the analysis of the concrete word into its abstract sounds and their signs is already accomplished; for this very reason, the process of learning to read is a primary occupation with abstract objects. In <i>geometry</i>, a beginning has to be made not with a concrete spatial figure but with the point and the line, and then plane figures, and among the latter not with polygons, but with the triangle, and among curves, with the circle.<br/><a name="HL3_802"></a>

In <i>physics</i> the individual natural properties or matters have to be freed from their manifold complications in which they are found in concrete actuality, and presented with their simple necessary conditions; they too, like spatial figures, are objects of intuition; but first the way for their intuition must be prepared so that they appear and are maintained free from all modifications by circumstances extraneous to their own specific character. Magnetism, electricity, the various gases, and so forth, are objects the specific character of which is ascertained by cognition only by apprehending them in isolation from the concrete conditions in which they appear in the actual world, Experiment, it is true, presents them to intuition in a concrete case; but for one thing experiment must, in order to be scientific, take only the conditions necessary for the purpose; and for another, it must multiply itself in order to show that the inseparable concretisation of these conditions is unessential, and this it does by exhibiting the things in another concrete shape and again in another, so that for cognition nothing remains but their abstract form.<br/><a name="HL3_803"></a>

To mention one more example, it might seem natural and intelligent to consider colour first, in the concrete manifestation of the animal's subjective sense, next, as a spectral phenomenon suspended outside the subject, and finally as fixed in objects in the actual external world. But for cognition, the universal and therefore truly primary form is the middle one of the above-named, in which colour hovers between subjectivity and objectivity as the familiar spectrum, completely unentangled as yet with subjective and objective circumstances. The latter above all merely disturb the pure consideration of the nature of this subject matter because they behave as active causes and therefore make it uncertain whether the specific alterations, transitions, and relationships of colour are founded in its own specific nature, or are rather to be attributed to the pathological specific constitution of those circumstances, to the healthy and the morbid particular affections and effects of the organs of the subject, or to the chemical, vegetable, and animal forces of the objects. Numerous other examples might be adduced from the cognition of organic nature and of the world of spirit; everywhere the abstract must constitute the starting point and the element in which and from which spread the particularities and rich formations of the concrete.<br/><a name="1738"></a>

Now although the difference of the particular from the universal makes its appearance, strictly speaking, with division or the particular this universal is itself already determinate and consequently only a member of a division. Hence there is for it a higher universal, and for this again a higher, and so on, in the first instance, to infinity. For the cognition here considered there is no immanent limit, since it starts from the <i>given, </i>and the form of abstract universality is characteristic of its <i>prius</i>. Therefore any subject matter whatever that seems to possess an elementary universality is made the subject matter of a specific science, and is an absolute beginning to the extent that <i>ordinary thought is presupposed </i>to be acquainted with it and it is taken on its own account as requiring no derivation. Definition takes it as immediate.<br/><a name="1739"></a>

The next step forward from this starting point is <i>division</i>. For this progress, only an immanent principle would be required, that is, a beginning from the universal and the Notion; but the cognition here considered lacks such a principle, for it only pursues the form determination of the Notion without its reflection-into-self, and therefore takes the determinateness of the content from what is given. For the particular that makes its appearance in division, there is no ground of its own available, either in regard to what is to constitute the basis of the division, or in regard to the specific relationship that the members of the disjunction are to have to one another. Consequently in this respect the business of cognition can only consist, partly, in setting in order the particular elements discovered in the empirical material, and partly, in finding the universal determinations of that particularity by comparison. These determinations are then accepted as grounds of division, and there may be a multiplicity of such grounds, as also a similar multiplicity of divisions based on them. The relationship between the members, the species, of a division, has only this general determination, that they are determined relatively to one another <i>in accordance with the assumed ground of division; </i>if their difference rested on a different consideration, they would not be coordinated on the same level with one another.<br/><a name="HL3_804"></a>

Because a principle of self-determination is lacking, the laws for this business of division can only consist of formal, empty rules that lead to nothing. Thus we see it laid down as a rule that division shall <i>exhaust </i>the notion; but as a matter of fact each individual member of the division must exhaust <i>the notion. </i>It is, however, really the <i>determinateness </i>of the notion that one means should be exhausted; but with the empirical multiplicity of species devoid of any immanent determination, it contributes nothing to the exhaustion of the notion whether more or fewer are found to exist; whether, for example, in addition to the sixty-seven species of parrots another dozen are found is for the exhaustion of the genus a matter of indifference. The demand for exhaustion can only mean the tautological proposition that all the species shall be presented in their <i>completeness. </i>Now with the extension of empirical knowledge it may very well happen that species are found which do not fit in with the adopted definition of the genus; for frequently the definition is adopted more on the basis of a vague conception of the entire <i>habitus</i>, rather than in accordance with a more or less individual mark that is expressly meant to serve for its definition. In such a case the genus would have to be modified and a justification would have to be found for regarding some other number of species as species of a new genus; in other words, the genus would be defined by what we group together in accordance with some principle or other that we choose to adopt as unity; and in this case the principle itself would be the basis of division. Conversely, if we hold to the determinateness originally adopted as characteristic of the genus, that material which we wished to group, as species, in a unity with the earlier species would be excluded. This unsystematic procedure, which sometimes adopts a determinateness as essential moment of the genus and then either subordinates the particulars to it or excludes them from it, and sometimes starts with the particular and in grouping it lets itself again be guided by some other determinateness, gives the appearance of the play of a caprice to which it is left to decide which part or which side of the concrete it will fix on and use as its principle of arrangement. Physical nature presents of itself such a contingency in the principles of division. By reason of its dependent external actuality it stands in a complex connectedness that for it likewise is given; accordingly there exists a crowd of principles to which it has to conform, and therefore in one series of its forms follows one principle, and in other series other principles, as well as producing hybrids that belong at the same time to different sides of the division. Thus it happens that in one series of natural objects marks stand out as very characteristic and essential that in others become inconspicuous and purposeless, so that it becomes impossible to adhere to a principle of division of this kind.<br/><a name="HL3_805"></a>

The general <i>determinateness </i>of empirical species can only consist in their being simply <i>different </i>from one another without being opposed. The <i>disjunction </i>of the <i>Notion </i>has been exhibited at an earlier stage in its determinateness; when particularity is assumed as immediate and given and without the negative unity of the Notion, the difference remains only at the stage of diversity as such, a form of reflection that we considered earlier. The externality in which the Notion chiefly exists in Nature brings with it the complete indifference of the difference; consequently, a frequent determination for division is taken from <i>number.</i><br/><a name="1742"></a>

Such is the contingency here of the particular in face of the universal and therefore of division generally, that it may be attributed to an <i>instinct </i>of reason when we find in this cognition grounds of division and divisions that, so far as sensuous properties permit, show themselves to be more adequate to the Notion. For example, in the case of animals, the instruments of eating, the teeth and claws, are employed in systems of classification as a broad radical ground of division; they are taken, in the first instance, merely as aspects in which the distinguishing marks for the subjective purposes of cognition can be more easily indicated. But as a matter of fact these organs do not merely imply a differentiation belonging to external reflection, but they are the vital point of animal individuality where it posits itself as a self-related individuality distinct from its other, from the nature that is external to it, and as an individuality that withdraws itself from continuity with the other. In the case of the <i>plant, </i>the fertilising organs constitute the highest point of vegetable life, by which the plant points to the transition into sex difference, and thereby into individual individuality. The system of botany has therefore rightly turned to this point for a principle of division that, if not adequate is far-reaching, and has thereby taken as its basis a determinateness that is not merely a determinateness for external reflection for purposes of comparison, but is in and for itself the highest of which the plant is capable.<br/>
<h6 id="HGL1212">3. The Theorem</h6>

1. The stage of this cognition that advances on the basis of the Notion-determinations is the transition of particularity into individuality; this constitutes the content of the <i>theorem. </i>What we have to consider here, then, is the <i>self-related determinateness, the</i> immanent difference of the object and the relation of the differentiated determinatenesses to one another. Definition contains only <i>one determinateness, </i>division contains determinateness in <i>relation to others; </i>in individualisation the object has gone asunder within itself. Whereas definition stops short at the general concept, in theorems, on the contrary, the object is cognised in its reality, in the conditions and forms of its real existence. Hence, in conjunction with definition, it represents the <i>Idea, </i>which is the unity of the Notion and reality. But the cognition here under consideration, which is still occupied in seeking, does not attain to this presentation in so far as the reality it deals with does not proceed from the Notion, and therefore the dependence of reality on the Notion and consequently the unity itself is not cognised.<br/><a name="1744"></a>

Now the theorem, according to the stated definition, is the genuinely <i>synthetic </i>aspect of an object in so far as the relationships of its determinatenesses are <i>necessary, </i>that is, are founded in the <i>inner identity </i>of the Notion. The synthetic element in definition and division is an externally adopted connection; what is found given is brought into the form of the Notion, but, as given, the entire content is merely <i>presented</i> [<i>monstriert</i>], whereas the theorem has to be <i>demonstrated. </i>As this cognition <i>does not deduce </i>the content of its definitions and the principles of its divisions, it seems as if it might spare itself the trouble of <i>proving </i>the relationships expressed by theorems and content itself in this respect, too, with observation. But what distinguishes cognition from mere observation and representation is the <i>form of the Notion </i>as such that cognition imparts to the content; this is achieved in definition and division: but as the content of the theorem comes from the Notion's moment of <i>individuality, </i>it consists in determinations of reality that no longer have for their relationship the simple and immediate determinations of the Notion; in individuality the Notion has passed over into <i>otherness, </i>into the reality whereby it becomes Idea. Thus the synthesis contained in the theorem no longer has the form of the Notion for its justification; it is a connection of [merely] <i>diverse </i>terms. Consequently the unity not yet posited with it has still to be demonstrated, and therefore proof becomes necessary even to this cognition.<br/><a name="HL3_807"></a>

Now here we are confronted first of all by the difficulty of <i>clearly distinguishing </i>which of the <i>determinations </i>of the <i>subject matter </i>may be admitted <i>into the definitions </i>and which are to be relegated to the <i>theorems. </i>On this point there cannot be any principle ready to hand; such a principle seems, perhaps, to be implied in the fact that what immediately belongs to an object appertains to the definition, whereas the rest, since it is mediated, must wait for its mediation to be demonstrated. But the content of definition is in general a determinate one, and therefore is itself essentially a mediated content; it has only a <i>subjective </i>immediacy, that is, the subject makes an arbitrary beginning and accepts a subject matter as presupposition. Now since this subject-matter is in general concrete within itself and must also be divided, the result is a number of determinations that are by their nature mediated, and are accepted not on the basis of any principle, but merely subjectively as immediate and unproved. Even in Euclid, who has always been justly recognised as the master in this synthetic kind of cognition, we find under the name of <i>axiom a presupposition</i> about <i>parallel lines </i>which has been thought to stand in need of proof, and various attempts to supply this want have been made. In several other theorems, people have thought that they had discovered presuppositions which should not have been immediately assumed but ought to have been proved. As regards the axiom concerning parallel lines, it may be remarked that it is precisely there that we may discern the sound sense of Euclid, who had appreciated exactly the element as well as the nature of his science. The proof of the said axiom would have had to be derived from the <i>notion </i>of parallel lines; but a proof of that kind is no more part of his science than is the deduction of his definitions, axioms and in general his subject matter, space itself and its immediate determinations, the three dimensions. Such a deduction can only be drawn from the Notion, and this lies outside the peculiar domain of Euclid's science; these are therefore necessarily <i>presuppositions </i>for it, relative firsts.<br/><a name="HL3_808"></a>

Axioms, to take this opportunity of mentioning them, belong to the same class. They are commonly but incorrectly taken as absolute firsts, as though in and for themselves they required no proof. Were this in fact the case, they would be mere tautologies, as it is only in abstract identity that no difference is present, and therefore no mediation required. If, however, axioms are more than tautologies, they are <i>propositions </i>from some <i>other science,</i> since for the science they serve as axioms they are meant to be presuppositions. Hence they are, strictly speaking, <i>theorems,</i> and theorems taken mostly from logic. The axioms of geometry are lemmata of this kind, logical propositions, which moreover approximate to tautologies because they are only concerned with magnitude and therefore qualitative differences are extinguished in them; the chief axiom, the purely quantitative syllogism, has been discussed above. Axioms, therefore, considered in and for themselves, require proof as much as definitions and divisions, and the only reason they are not made into theorems is that, as relatively first for a certain standpoint, they are assumed as presuppositions.<br/><a name="1747"></a>

As regards the <i>content of theorems, </i>we must now make a more precise distinction. As the content consists in a <i>relation between determinatenesses </i>of the Notion's reality, these relations may be more or less incomplete and single relationships of the subject matter, or else may be a relationship embracing the <i>entire content</i> of the reality and expressing the determinate relation of that content. But the <i>unity of the complete determinatenesses of the content</i> is equivalent to the Notion; consequently a proposition that contains them is itself again a definition, but a definition that expresses not merely the immediately assumed Notion, but the Notion developed into its determinate real differences, or the complete existence of the Notion. The two together, therefore, present the <i>Idea.</i><br/><a name="HL3_809"></a>

If we compare closely the theorems of a synthetic science, especially of <i>geometry, </i>we shall find this difference, that some of its theorems involve only single relationships of the subject matter, while others involve relationships in which the complete determinateness of the subject matter is expressed. It is a very superficial view that assigns equal importance to all the propositions on the ground that in general each contains a truth and is equally essential in the formal progress, in the context, of the proof. The difference in respect of the content of theorems is most intimately connected with this progress itself; some further remarks on the latter will serve to elucidate in more detail this difference as well as the nature of synthetic cognition. To begin with, Euclidean geometry - which as representative of the synthetic method, of which it furnishes the most perfect specimen, shall serve us as example - has always been extolled for the ordered arrangement in the sequence of the theorems, by which for each theorem the propositions requisite for its construction and proof are always found already proved. This circumstance concerns formal consecutiveness; yet, important as it is, it is still rather a matter of an external arrangement for the purpose of the matter in hand and has on its own account no relation to the essential difference of Notion and Idea in which lies a higher principle of the necessity of the progress. That is to say, the definitions with which we begin, apprehend the sensuous object as immediately given and determine it according to its proximate genus and specific difference; these are likewise the simple, <i>immediate </i>determinatenesses of the Notion, universality and particularity, whose relationship is no further developed. Now the initial theorems themselves can only make use of immediate determinations such as are contained in the definitions; similarly their reciprocal <i>dependence, </i>in the first instance, can only relate to this general point, that one is simply <i>determined </i>by the other. Thus Euclid's first propositions about triangles deal only with <i>congruence, </i>that is, <i>how many </i>parts in a triangle <i>must be determined, </i>in order that the <i>remaining </i>parts of one and the same triangle, or the whole of it, shall be <i>altogether determined. </i>The comparison of two triangles with one another, and the basing of congruence on <i>coincidence </i>is a detour necessary to a method that is forced to employ <i>sensuous coincidence </i>instead of the <i>thought, </i>namely, the <i>determinateness </i>of the triangles.<br/><a name="HL3_810"></a>

Considered by themselves apart from this method, these theorems themselves contain two parts, one of which may be regarded as the <i>Notion,</i> and the other as the <i>reality, </i>as the element that completes the former into reality. That is to say, whatever completely determines a triangle, for example two sides and the included angle, is already the whole triangle for the <i>understanding; </i>nothing further is required for its complete determinateness; the remaining two angles and the third side are the superfluity of reality over the determinateness of the Notion. Accordingly what these theorems really do is to reduce the sensuous triangle, which of course requires three sides and three angles, to its simplest conditions. The definition had mentioned only the three lines in general that enclose the plane figure and make it a triangle; it is a theorem that first expresses the fact that the angle is <i>determined </i>by the determination of the sides, just as the remaining theorems contain dependence of three other parts on three others. But the complete immanent determinateness of the magnitude of a triangle in terms of its sides is contained in the theorem of Pythagoras; here we have first the <i>equation </i>of the sides of the triangle, for in the preceding propositions the sides are in general only brought into a <i>reciprocal determinateness </i>of the parts of the triangle, not into an <i>equation. </i>This proposition is therefore the perfect, <i>real definition</i> of the triangle, that is, of the right-angled triangle in the first instance, the triangle that is simplest in its differences and therefore the most regular. Euclid closes the first book with this proposition, for in it a perfect determinateness is achieved. So, too, in the second book, after reducing to the uniform type those triangles which are not right-angles and are affected with greater inequality, he concludes with the reduction of the rectangle to the square - with an equation between the self-equal, or the square, and that which is in its own self unequal, or the rectangle; similarly in the theorem of Pythagoras, the hypotenuse, which corresponds to the right-angle, to the self-equal, constitutes one side of the equation, while the other is constituted by the self-unequal, the two remaining sides. The above equation between the square and the rectangle is the basis of the <i>second </i>definition of the circle - which again is the theorem of Pythagoras, except that here the two sides forming the right-angle are taken as variable magnitudes. The first equation of the circle is in precisely that relationship of <i>sensuous </i>determinateness to <i>equation </i>that holds between the two different definitions of conic sections in general.<br/><a name="HL3_811"></a>

This genuine synthetic advance is a transition from <i>universality to individuality, </i>that is, <i>to that which is determined in and for itself,</i> or to the unity of the subject matter <i>within itself, </i>where the subject matter has been sundered and differentiated into its essential real determinatenesses. But in the other sciences, the usual and quite imperfect advance is commonly on the following lines; the beginning is, indeed, made with a universal, but its <i>individualisation </i>and concretion is merely an <i>application </i>of the universal to a material introduced from elsewhere; in this way, the really <i>individual </i>element of the Idea is an <i>empirical </i>addition.<br/><a name="1751"></a>

Now however complete or incomplete the content of the theorem may be, it must be <i>proved. </i>It is a relationship of real determinations that do not have the relationship of Notion-determinations; if they do have this relation, and it can be shown that they do in the propositions that we have called the <i>second </i>or <i>real definitions, </i>then first, such propositions are for that very reason definitions; but secondly, because their content at the same time consists not merely in the relationship of a universal and the simple determinateness, but also in relationships of real determinations, in comparison with such first definition, they do require and permit of proof. As real determinatenesses they have the form of <i>indifferent subsistence and diversity; </i>hence they are not immediately one and therefore their mediation must be demonstrated. The immediate unity in the first definition is that unity in accordance with which the particular is in the universal.<br/><a name="1752"></a>

2. Now the <i>mediation, </i>which we have next to consider in detail, may be simple or may pass through several mediations. The mediating members are connected with those to be mediated; but in this cognition, since mediation and theorem are not derived from the Notion, to which transition into an opposite is altogether alien, the mediating determinations, in the absence of any concept of connection, must be imported from somewhere or other as a preliminary material for the framework of the proof This preparatory procedure is the <i>construction.</i><br/><a name="1753"></a>

Among the relations of the content of the theorem, which relations may be very varied, only those now must be adduced and demonstrated which serve the proof. This provision of material only comes to have meaning in the proof; in itself it appears blind and unmeaning. Subsequently, we see of course that it served the purpose of the proof to draw, for example, such further lines in the geometrical figure as the construction specifies; but during the construction itself we must blindly obey; on its own account, therefore, this operation is unintelligent, since the end that directs it is not yet expressed. It is a matter of indifference whether the construction is carried out for the purpose of a theorem proper or a problem; such as it appears in the first instance <i>before </i>the proof, it is something not derived from the determination given in the theorem or problem, and is therefore a meaningless act for anyone who does not know the end it serves, and in any case an act directed by an external end.<br/><a name="HL3_812"></a>

This meaning of the construction which at first is still concealed comes to light in the <i>proof. </i>As stated, the proof contains the mediation of what the theorem enunciates as connected; through this mediation this connection first <i>appears as necessary. </i>Just as the construction by itself lacks the subjectivity of the Notion, so the proof is a subjective act lacking objectivity. That is to say, because the content determinations of the theorem are not at the same time posited as Notion-determinations but as given <i>indifferent parts</i> standing in various external relationships to one another, it is only the <i>formal, external </i>Notion in which the necessity manifests itself. The proof is not a <i>genesis </i>of the relationship that constitutes the content of the theorem; the necessity exists only for intelligence, and the whole proof is in the <i>subjective interests of cognition. </i>It is therefore an altogether <i>external </i>reflection that <i>proceeds from without inwards, </i>that is, infers from external circumstances the inner constitution of the relationship. The circumstances that the construction has presented, are a <i>consequence </i>of the nature of the subject matter; here, conversely, they are made the <i>ground </i>and <i>the mediating </i>relationships. Consequently the middle term, the third, in which the terms united in the theorem present themselves in their unity and which furnishes the nerve of the proof, is only something in which this connection <i>appears </i>and is <i>external</i> Because the <i>sequence </i>that this process of proof pursues is really the reverse of the nature of the fact, what is regarded as <i>ground</i> in it is a subjective ground, the nature of the fact emerging from it only for cognition.<br/><a name="HL3_813"></a>

The foregoing considerations make clear the necessary limit of this cognition, which has very often been misunderstood. The shining example of the synthetic method is the science of <i>geometry</i> - but it has been inaptly applied to other sciences as well, even to philosophy. Geometry is a science of <i>magnitude, </i>and therefore formal reasoning is most appropriate to it; it treats of the merely quantitative determination and abstracts from the qualitative, and can therefore confine itself to <i>formal identity, </i>to the unity that lacks the Notion, which is <i>equality </i>and which belongs to the external abstractive reflection. Its subject matter, the determinations of space, are already such abstract subject matter, prepared for the purpose of having a completely finite external determinateness. This science, on account of its abstract subject matter, on the one hand, has this element of the sublime about it, that in these empty silent spaces colour is blotted out and the other sensuous properties have vanished, and further, that in it every other interest that appeals more intimately to the living individuality is silenced. On the other hand, the abstract subject matter is still space, a non-sensuous sensuous; intuition is raised into its abstraction; space is a <i>form </i>of intuition, but is still intuition, and so sensuous, the <i>asunderness </i>of sensuousness itself, its pure <i>absence of Notion. </i>We have heard enough talk lately about the excellence of geometry from this aspect; the fact that it is based on sensuous intuition has been declared its supreme excellence and people have even imagined that this is the ground of its highly scientific character, and that its proofs rest on intuition. This shallow view must be countered by the plain reminder that no science is brought about by intuition, but only by <i>thinking</i>. The intuitive character of geometry that derives from its still sensuous material only gives it that evidential side that the <i>sensuous </i>as such possesses for unthinking spirit. It is therefore lamentable that this sensuousness of its material has been accounted an advantage, whereas it really indicates the inferiority of its standpoint. It is solely to the <i>abstraction </i>of its sensuous subject matter that it owes its capability of attaining a higher scientific character; and it is to this abstraction that it owes its great superiority over those collections of information that people are also pleased to call sciences, which have for their content the concrete perceptible material of sense, and only indicate by the order which they seek to introduce into it a remote inkling and hint of the requirements of the Notion.<br/><a name="HL3_814"></a>

It is only because the space of geometry is the abstraction and void of asunderness that it is possible for the figures to be inscribed in the indeterminateness of that space in such a manner that their determinations remain in fixed repose outside another and possess no immanent transition into an opposite. The science of these determinations is, accordingly, a simple science of the finite that is compared in respect of magnitude and whose unity is the external unity of <i>equality. </i>But at the same time the delineation of these figures starts from various aspects and principles and the various figures arise independently; accordingly, the comparison of them makes apparent also their <i>qualitative </i>unlikeness and <i>incommensurability. </i>This development impels geometry beyond the <i>finitude</i> in which it was advancing so methodically and surely to <i>infinity </i>to the positing of things as equal that are qualitatively different. Here it loses the evidential side that it possessed in its other aspect, where it is based on a stable finitude and is untouched by the Notion and its manifestation, the transition just mentioned. At this point the finite science has reached its limit; for the necessity and mediation of the synthetic method is no longer grounded merely in <i>positive </i>but in <i>negative identity.</i><br/><a name="HL3_814a"></a>

If then geometry, like algebra, with its abstract, non-dialectical [<i>bloss versandigen</i>] subject matter soon encounters its limit, it is evident from the very outset that the synthetic method is still more inadequate for <i>other sciences, </i>and most inadequate of all in the domain of philosophy. In regard to definition and division we have already ascertained the relevant facts, and here only theorem and proof should remain to be discussed. But besides the presupposition of definition and division which already demands and presupposes proof, the inadequacy of this method consists further in the general <i>position </i>of definition and division in relation to theorems. This position is especially noteworthy in the case of the empirical sciences such as physics, for example, when they want to give themselves the form of synthetic sciences. The method is then as follows. The <i>reflective determinations </i>of particular <i>forces </i>or other inner and essence-like forms which result from the method of analysing experience and can be justified only as <i>results, </i>must be <i>placed in the forefront </i>in order that they may provide a general <i>foundation </i>that is subsequently <i>applied to the individual </i>and demonstrated in it. These general foundations having no support of their own, we are supposed for the time being to take them <i>for granted; </i>only when we come to the derived <i>consequences </i>do we notice that the latter constitute the real <i>ground</i> of those <i>foundations</i>.<br/><a name="HL3_815"></a>
<span class="vil">
The so-called <i>explanation</i> and the proof of the concrete brought into theorem turns out to be partly a tautology, partly a derangement of the true relationship, and further, too, a derangement that served to conceal the deception practised here by cognition, which has taken up empirical data one-sidedly , and only by doing so has been able to obtain its simple definitions and principles; and it obviates any empirical refutation by taking up and accepting as valid the data of experience, not in their concrete totality but in a particular instance, and that too, in the direction helpful to its hypotheses and theory. In this subordination of concrete experience to presupposed determinations, the foundation of the theory is obscured and is exhibited only from the side that is conformable to the theory; </span>and in general the unprejudiced examination of concrete observations on their own is made more difficult. Only by turning the entire process upside down does the whole thing get its right relationship in which the connection of grounds and consequent, and the correctness of the transformation of perception into thought can be surveyed. Hence one of the chief difficulties in the study of such sciences is <i>to effect an entrance into them</i>; and this can only be done if the presuppositions are <i>blindly taken for granted</i>, and straightway, without being able to form any Notion of them, in fact with barely a definite representation but at most a confused picture in the imagination, to impress upon one's memory for the time being the determinations of the assumed forces and matters, and their hypothetical formations, directions and rotations. If, in order to accept these presuppositions a valid, we demand their necessity and their Notion, we cannot get beyond the starting point.<br/><a name="1759"></a>

We had occasion above to speak of the inappropriateness of applying the synthetic method to strictly analytic science. This application has been extended by Wolf to every possible kind of information, which he dragged into philosophy and mathematics information partly of a wholly analytical nature, and partly too of a contingent and merely professional and occupational kind. The contrast between a material of this kind, easily grasped and by its nature incapable of any rigorous and scientific treatment, and the stiff circumlocutory language of science in which it is clothed, has of itself demonstrated the clumsiness of such application and discredited it.<br/>

[For example, in Wolf's <i>First Principles of Architecture</i>, the Eighth Theorem runs: A window must be wide enough for two persons to be able to look out side by side in comfort.<br>
<i>Proof: </i>It is quite usual for a person to be at the window with another person and to look out.

Nevertheless, this misuse could not detract from the belief in the aptness and essentiality of this method for attaining scientific rigour in <i>philosophy</i>; Spinoza's example in the exposition of his philosophy has long been accepted as a model. But as a matter of fact, <span class="vil">the whole style of previous metaphysics, its method included, has been exploded by Kant and Jacobi. Kant, in his own manner has shown that the content of that metaphysics leads by strict demonstration to <i>antimonies</i></span>, whose nature in other respects has been elucidated in the relevant places; but he <a name="HL3_816a"></a><span class="vil">has not reflected on the nature of this demonstration itself that is linked to a finite content; yet the two must stand and fall together</span>. In his <i>First Principles of Natural Science</i>, he has himself given an example of treating as a science of reflection, and in the method of such, a science that he thought by that method to claim for philosophy. If Kant attacked previous metaphysics rather in respect of its matter, Jacobi has attacked it chiefly on the side of its method of demonstration, and has signalised most clearly and most profoundly the essential point, namely, that method of demonstration such as this is fast bound within the circle of the rigid necessity of the finite, and that <i>freedom</i>, that is the <i>Notion</i>, and with it <i>everything that is true</i>, lies beyond it and is unattainable by it. According to the Kantian result, it is the peculiar matter of metaphysics that leads it into contradictions, and the inadequacy of cognition consists in its <i>subjectivity</i>; according to Jacobi's result, the fault lies with the method and the entire nature of cognition itself, which only apprehends a connection of <i>conditionedness</i> and <i>dependence</i> and therefore proves itself inadequate to what is in and for itself, to what is absolutely true.
 <br/><a name="HL3_817"></a>

In point of fact, as the principle of philosophy is the <i>infinite free Notion, </i>and all its content rests on that alone, the method proper to Notion-less finitude is inappropriate to it. The synthesis and mediation of this method, <i>the process of proof, </i>gets no further than a <i>necessity </i>that is the opposite of freedom, that is, to an <i>identity </i>of the dependent that is merely <i>implicit [an sich</i>], whether it be conceived as <i>internal </i>or as <i>external, </i>and in this identity, that which constitutes the reality in it, the differentiated element that has emerged into concrete existence, remains simply an <i>independent diversity </i>and therefore something finite. Consequently this <i>identity </i>does not achieve <i>concrete existence </i>here and remains merely <i>internal, </i>or, from another point of view, merely <i>external, </i>since its determinate content is given to it; from either point of view it is an abstract identity and does not possess within it the side of reality, and is not posited as <i>identity </i>that is <i>determinate </i>in and for itself. Consequently the <i>Notion, </i>with which alone we are concerned, and which is the infinite in and for itself, is excluded from this cognition.<br/>
<a name="HL3_817"></a>

In synthetic cognition, therefore, the Idea attains its end only to the extent that the <i>Notion</i> becomes <i>for the Notion</i> according to its <i>moments</i> of <i>identity</i> and <i>real determinations</i>, or of <i>universality</i> and <i>particular differences</i> — further also <i>as an identity</i> that is the <i>connection</i> and <i>dependence</i> of the diverse elements. <a name="HL3_817a"></a>But this subject matter of the Notion is not adequate to it; for <span class="vil">the Notion does not come to be the <i>unity of itself with itself in its subject matter or its reality</i></span>; in necessity its identity is for it; but in this identity the necessity is not itself the <i>determinateness</i>, but appears as a matter external to the identity, that is, as a matter not determined by the Notion, a matter, therefore, in which the Notion does not cognise itself. Thus in general the Notion is not for itself, is not at the same time determined in and for itself according to its unity. <a name="HL3_817b"></a><span class="vil">Hence in this cognition the Idea which falls short of truth on account of the inadequacy of the subject matter to the subjective Notion. But the sphere of necessity is the apex of being and reflection; through its own essential nature it passes into its manifestation, which is the Notion as Notion.</span> How this <i>transition</i> from the sphere of necessity into the Notion is effected <i>in principle</i> has been shown in treating of necessity; the same transition also presented itself as the <i>genesis</i> of the Notion at the beginning of this Book. <br/><a name="HL3_818"></a>

Here <i>necessity</i> has the position of being the <i>reality</i> or <i>subject matter</i> of the Notion, just as the Notion into which it passes now appears as the Notion's subject matter. But the transition itself is the same. Here too it is only at first <i>implicit</i> and lies as yet outside cognition in our reflection; that is, it is still the inner necessity of the cognition itself. It is only the result that is for it.<br/>
