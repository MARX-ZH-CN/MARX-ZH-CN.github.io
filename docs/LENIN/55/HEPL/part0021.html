<body> <h2 id="HGL201">B. The object</h2> <h6 id="s194">§194</h6> <div>The object is immediate being by virtue of the indifference towards the difference that has sublated itself in it. It is in itself the totality and, at the same time, since this identity is the identity of the moments but an identity that only is in itself [<i>ansichseiende</i>], it is just as indifferent to its immediate unity. It breaks down into differentiated [moments], each of which is itself the totality. The object is thus the absolute <i>contradiction</i> of the complete self-sufficiency of the manifold and the equally complete lack of self-sufficiency of the differentiated [moments].</div> <div class="remark">The definition 'the absolute is the object' is contained in the most determinate manner in the <i>Leibnizian monad</i> which is supposed to be an object, yet [an object] <i>in itself</i> representing [things] and, indeed, is supposed to be the totality of the representation of the world. In its simple unity, every difference is merely something ideal, something not self-sufficient. Nothing enters into the monad from the outside; it is in itself the entire concept, only differentiated by its own greater or lesser development. By the same token, this simple totality breaks down into the absolute plurality of differences such that they are self-sufficient monads. In the monad of monads and the pre-established harmony of their inner developments, these substances are just as much reduced in turn to the level of something ideal and lacking in self-sufficiency. The Leibnizian philosophy is thus the perfectly developed <i>contradiction</i>.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 1</i>. Construing the absolute (God) as the object and not moving beyond such a construal is in general the standpoint of superstition and slavish fear, as Fichte above all has rightly emphasized in recent times. To be sure, God is the object, and indeed the object without qualification, opposite which our particular (subjective) opinions and wants have no truth and no validity. But precisely as the absolute object, God does not stand like some sinister and inimical power over against subjectivity. Instead God contains subjectivity as an essential factor within himself. This point is formulated in the teachings of the Christian religion, when it is said that God wants for all human beings to be helped and wants all of them to be blessed. That human beings are helped, that they are blessed, this happens by virtue of the fact that they attain consciousness of their unity with God and God ceases to be for them a mere object and thereby just an object [<i>Gegenstand</i>] of fear and terror, as was the case for the religious consciousness of the Romans in particular. If, furthermore, in the Christian religion, God is known [<i>gewußt</i>] as love, and indeed insofar as he revealed himself to humanity in his Son, who is one with him, and did so as this individual human being, by this means redeeming humanity, this says likewise that the opposition of objectivity and subjectivity is <i>in itself</i> overcome and the basic matter for us is to participate in this redemption by letting go of our immediate subjectivity (taking off the old Adam) and becoming conscious of God as our true and essential self. – Now, just as religion and the religious culture consists in overcoming the opposition of subjectivity and objectivity, so too science, and more precisely philosophy, has no other task than to overcome this opposition through thinking. In the case of knowing, what generally needs to be done is to strip away the alienness of the objective world standing over against us, to find our way into it, as one says, which amounts to saying that we need to trace the objective [dimension] back to the concept which is our innermost self. From the previous discussion it can be gathered how wrong it is to consider subjectivity and objectivity a rigid and abstract opposition. Both are utterly dialectical. In keeping with its own activity, without needing any external material or stuff, the concept which at first is only subjective proceeds to objectify itself, and so too the object is not something immovable and devoid of process, but instead is the process of proving itself to be at the same time the subjective [dimension] that forms the progression to the <i>idea</i>. What happens to anyone who is not familiar with the determinations of subjectivity and objectivity, preferring to hold fast to them in their abstraction, is that these abstract determinations slip through his fingers before he lays hold on them and he says precisely the opposite of what he wanted to say.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 2</i>. Objectivity contains the three forms: <i>mechanism, chemism</i>, and <i>the relation of purpose</i>. The <i>mechanically</i> determined object is the immediate, indifferent object. It contains difference, to be sure, but the diverse [elements] behave indifferently towards one another and the combination of them is only external to them. In <i>chemism</i>, by contrast, the object demonstrates itself to be essentially different, such that the objects are what they are only through their relation to one another and the difference constitutes their quality. The third form of objectivity, the <i>teleological relationship</i>, is the unity of mechanism and chemism. The purpose is again, like the mechanical object, a totality enclosed within itself, yet enriched by the principle of difference [<i>Differenz</i>] that emerged in chemism, and so it [the purpose] refers to the object standing over against it. It is the realization of the purpose, then, that forms the transition to the <i>idea</i>.</div> <h3 id="HGL202">a. Mechanism</h3> <h6 id="s195">§195</h6> <div>The object, taken first in its immediacy, is (1) the concept only <i>in itself</i>; it has the concept at first as something subjective <i>outside it</i>, and every determinacy is posited as an external determinacy. As the unity of differences, it is thus something <i>composite</i>, an aggregate, and the effect on another remains an external relation: <i>formal mechanism</i>. – In this relation and lack of self-sufficiency, the objects remain equally self-sufficient, resistant, <i>external</i> to one another.</div> <div class="remark">Just as pressure and impulse are mechanical relationships, so we also know [<i>wissen</i>] in a mechanical way, <i>by rote</i> [<i>auswendig</i>], insofar as the words are devoid of any sense for us and remain external to the senses, representing, thinking; they [the words] are equally external to themselves, a senseless sequence. Acting, piety, and so forth are equally <i>mechanical</i> insofar as what a person does is determined by ceremonial laws, a counsel of conscience, and so forth, while his own spirit and will are not in his actions, such that these actions are external to him himself.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. Mechanism, as the first form of objectivity, is also that very category that first presents itself to reflection in observation of the objective [<i>gegenständlich</i>] world and a category from which this observation quite frequently does not budge. Nevertheless, this is a superficial manner of observation, lacking in thought, insufficient for making do either in relation to nature or even less in relation to the spiritual world. In nature only the completely abstract relationships of matter (insofar as it remains locked up in itself) are subject to mechanism. By contrast, even the phenomena and processes of the so-called 'physical domain' in the narrower sense of the word (for example, the phenomena of light, heat, magnetism, electricity, and so forth) cannot be explained in a merely mechanical manner (i.e. through pressure, impulse, displacement of parts, etc.). Even more unsatisfactory is the application and transference of this category to the domain of organic nature, insofar as it is a matter of conceiving what is specific to it: for example, the nourishment and growth of plants or even animal sensation. In any case it must be regarded as a quite essential deficiency, indeed, the chief deficiency of modern research into nature that, even where it is a matter of completely different and higher categories than those of mere mechanism, it nevertheless stubbornly clings to the latter, contradicting what presents itself to an unprejudiced observation [<i>Anschauung</i>], and by this means blocks the path to an adequate knowledge of nature. – Next, with regard to the formations of the spiritual world, here too in the consideration of them the mechanical perspective has been unduly promoted in various ways. This is the case, for example, if it is said that a human being <i>consists</i> of body and soul. In this assertion these two count as subsisting each for themselves and as being combined with one another only externally. It also happens when the soul is regarded as a mere complex of forces and faculties, subsisting self-sufficiently next to one another. – Thus, on the one hand, the mechanical manner of observation must be rejected out of hand where it comes on the scene with the pretension of occupying the position of conceptual knowing in general and making mechanism the absolute category. Yet, on the other hand, mechanism's legitimacy and meaning as a universal, logical category must also be expressly vindicated, and accordingly by no means should it be limited merely to the domain of nature from which this category's name is taken. Thus, there is nothing to object to if attention is paid to mechanical actions (e.g. those of weight, lever, and so forth) even outside the realm of genuine mechanics, particularly in physics and in physiology. Only it should not be overlooked thereby that within these domains the laws of mechanism are no longer the decisive ones, but make their appearance only, as it were, in a subservient position. Immediately linked to this point is then the further remark that where the higher functions in nature, namely, the organic functions, suffer a disturbance or hindrance in one way or another in their normal effectiveness, the otherwise subordinate mechanism immediately emerges as dominating. Thus, for example, someone suffering from a weak stomach has a sensation of <i>pressure</i> in the stomach after consuming a modest quantity of certain foods, while others whose digestive organs are healthy remain free of this sensation, despite having consumed the same thing. This is also the case with the general feeling of <i>heaviness</i> in the arms and legs when the body is in a sickly mood. – Even in the domain of the spiritual world, mechanism has its place, albeit a place that is likewise merely subordinate. One speaks rightly of mechanical memory and of all sorts of mechanical activities such as, for example, reading, writing, playing music, and so forth. More precisely in this connection, as far as memory is concerned, a mechanical manner of behaving is even inherent in its essence; a circumstance that has often been overlooked by modern pedagogy, to the great detriment of the education of youth, in a mistaken zeal for freedom of the intelligence. Nevertheless, someone would prove to be a bad psychologist if, in order to fathom the nature of memory, he were to take flight to mechanics and apply its laws without further ado to the soul. The mechanical dimension of memory precisely consists solely in the fact that here certain signs, sounds, and so forth are construed in their merely external combination and then reproduced in this combination, without it being necessary thereby to attend explicitly to their meaning and inner combination. In order to recognize this connection with mechanical memory, no further study of mechanics is needed, and from this study there is nothing to be gained for psychology as such.</div> <h6 id="s196">§196</h6> <div>Only insofar as the object is self-sufficient (see the preceding section) does it have the lack of self-sufficiency in terms of which it suffers <i>violence</i>. Insofar as the object is the posited concept in itself, neither of these determinations sublates itself in its other determination; instead the object joins itself together with itself through the negation of itself, through its lack of self-sufficiency, and only then is it self-sufficient. Thus, at the same time, in the difference from externality, and in its self-sufficiency negating this externality, it [the object] is the <i>negative unity</i> with itself, <i>centrality</i>, subjectivity – in which it is itself directed and related to the external. The latter is equally centred in itself and, in that, just as much related to the other centre, having its centrality just as much in the other. [Hence, the object in the second place is] (2) a <i>differentiated</i> [<i>differenter</i>] mechanism (fall, desire, social drive, and the like).</div> <h6 id="s197">§197</h6> <div>The development of this relationship forms the syllogistic inference that the immanent negativity as the <i>central</i> individuality of an object (the abstract centre) relates itself to objects lacking self-sufficiency as the other extreme, relating to them through a middle [term] that unifies the objects' centrality and lack of self-sufficiency, the relative centre. [Hence, the object is] (3) <i>absolute mechanism</i>.</div> <h6 id="s198">§198</h6> <div>The syllogism that has been given here (I – P – U) is a triad of syllogistic inferences. The flawed <i>individuality</i> of the objects <i>lacking self-sufficiency</i>, in which the formal mechanism is at home, is, in keeping with its lack of self-sufficiency, just as much the external <i>universality</i>. These objects are thus the <i>middle</i> also between the <i>absolute</i> and the <i>relative</i> centre (the form of the syllogism: U – I – P). For it is by means of this lack of self-sufficiency that those two are separated and are extremes just as they are related to one another. So, too, the <i>absolute centrality</i> as the substantial universal (the gravity that remains identical), which as the pure negativity also encapsulates in itself the individuality, is the mediating factor between the <i>relative centre</i> and the objects <i>lacking self-sufficiency</i>; ([thus amounting to] the form of the inference P – U – I) and, to be sure, just as essential in terms of the immanent individuality where it functions to separate, as it is in terms of the universality as the identical cohesion and as the undisturbed being-in-itself. </div> <div class="remark">Like the solar system, the state, for instance, is, in the practical sphere, a system of three syllogisms. (1) The <i>individual</i> (the person) joins itself through its <i>particularity</i> (physical and spiritual needs, what becomes the civil society, once they have been further developed for themselves) with the <i>universal</i> (the society, justice, law, government). (2) The will, the activity of individuals, is the mediating factor which satisfies the needs in relation to society, the law, and so forth, just as it fulfils and realizes the society, the law, and so forth. (3) But the universal (state, government, law) is the substantial middle [term] in which the individuals and their satisfaction have and acquire their fulfilled reality, mediation, and subsistence. Since the mediation joins each of the determinations with the other extreme, each joins itself precisely in this way together with itself; it produces itself and this production is its self-preservation. – It is only through the nature of this joining-together, through this triad of syllogisms with the same <i>terminis</i>, that a whole is truly understood in its organization.</div> <h6 id="s199">§199</h6> <div>The <i>immediacy</i> of concrete existence that objects have in absolute mechanism is <i>in itself</i> negated by the fact that their self-sufficiency is mediated by their relations to one another, hence, through their lack of self-sufficiency. Thus, the object must be posited as <i>differentiated</i> [<i>different</i>], in its <i>concrete existence</i>, opposite <i>its</i> other.</div> <h3 id="HGL203">b. Chemism</h3> <h6 id="s200">§200</h6> <div>The <i>differentiated</i> [<i>differente</i>] object has an immanent <i>determinacy</i> constituting its nature and in that determinacy it has concrete existence. But as the posited totality of the <i>concept</i>, it is the contradiction of this its totality and the determinacy of its concrete existence [<i>Existenz</i>]; it is thus the [process of] striving to sublate this contradiction and make its existence [<i>Dasein</i>] equal to the concept. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. Chemism is a category of objectivity that as a rule does not tend to be stressed particularly. Instead it is usually taken together with mechanism as one and, in this manner of taking them together, under the common title 'mechanistic relationship', it is opposed to the relationship of <i>purposiveness</i>. The motivation for this is to be sought in the fact that <i>mechanism</i> and <i>chemism</i> have, indeed, this in common: each is initially the concretely existing concept only <i>in itself</i>, whereas the <i>purpose</i>, by contrast, is to be regarded as the concept existing concretely <i>for itself</i>. Nonetheless, mechanism and chemism also differ from one another very specifically, namely, in the way that the object, in the form of mechanism, is initially only an indifferent relation to itself, whereas the chemical object, by contrast, demonstrates itself to be related straightaway to an other. Now, to be sure, even in the case of mechanism, as it develops, relations to an other are already emerging. But the relation of the mechanical objects to one another is only an external relation initially, such that the objects related to one another are left with the semblance [<i>Schein</i>] of self-sufficiency. Thus, for example, in nature the various heavenly bodies that form the solar system are connected by their movements and, by this means, demonstrate that they are related to one another. Yet motion, as the unity of space and time, is nothing but an utterly external and abstract relation and so it seems as though the heavenly bodies, related in such an external manner to one another, would be and even remain what they are without this relation that they have to one another. – In the case of chemism, by contrast, things behave otherwise. Chemically differentiated [<i>chemisch-differenten</i>] objects are explicitly what they are, only through their difference [<i>Differenz</i>], and are thus the absolute drive to integrate themselves through and with one another.</div> <h6 id="s201">§201</h6> <div>The chemical process thus has as its product the <i>neutral</i> dimension of these strung-out extremes, a neutral dimension which these extremes are <i>in themselves</i>; by means of the differentiation of the objects (the particularization), the concept, i.e. the concrete universal, joins itself [<i>schließt sich…zusammen</i>] with the individuality, i.e. the product, and so merely with itself. Equally contained in this process are the other syllogisms; the individuality, as activity, is likewise the mediating factor just like the concrete universal, the essence of the strung-out extremes, which enters into existence [<i>Dasein</i>] in the product.</div> <h6 id="s202">§202</h6> <div>Chemism, as the reflexive relationship [<i>Reflexionsverhältnis</i>] of objectivity, still presupposes, together with the differentiated [<i>different</i>] nature of the objects, the <i>immediate</i> self-sufficiency of those same objects. The process is that of passing back and forth from one form into the other, forms that at the same time still remain external. – In the neutral product, the determinate properties that the extremes had opposite one another are sublated. This is, indeed, in keeping with the concept; but the <i>animating</i> principle of differentiating does not exist concretely in it since it has sunk back into immediacy. For this reason, the neutral dimension is a separable dimension. Yet the judging principle that severs the neutral dimension into differentiated [<i>differente</i>] extremes and gives the undifferentiated [<i>indifferent</i>] objects in general their difference [<i>Differenz</i>] and animation opposite an other falls outside that first process, and so does the process as the separation that strings things out. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The chemical process is still a finite, conditioned process. The concept as such is as yet only the inner dimension of this process and does not yet come into concrete existence in its being-for-itself. In the neutral product, the process is extinguished and what stirs things up falls outside the process.</div> <h6 id="s203">§203</h6> <div>The <i>externality</i> of these two processes, the reduction of what are differentiated [<i>Differenten</i>] to something neutral and the differentiation of the undifferentiated [<i>Differenzierung des Indifferenten</i>] or neutral, which allows them to appear as self-sufficient opposite one another, shows its finitude in passing over into products in which they are sublated. Conversely, the process presents the presupposed immediacy of the differentiated [<i>differenten</i>] objects as a vacuous immediacy. – By means of this <i>negation</i> of externality and immediacy, into which the concept as object was immersed, it is posited <i>freely</i> and <i>for itself opposite</i> that externality and immediacy – <i>as purpose</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The transition from chemism to the teleological relationship is entailed by the fact that the two forms of the chemical process reciprocally sublate one another. In this way it comes about that the concept, initially only present <i>in itself</i> in chemism and in mechanism, becomes free, and the concept, thus existing concretely for itself, is the <i>purpose</i>.</div> <h3 id="HGL204">c. Teleology</h3> <h6 id="s204">§204</h6> <div>Purpose is the concept that is <i>for itself</i> and that has entered into a free concrete existence [<i>Existenz</i>] via the <i>negation</i> of immediate objectivity. It is determined as something <i>subjective</i>, in that this negation initially is <i>abstract</i> and thus objectivity also only stands over against it [i.e. the purpose] at first. In contrast to the totality of the concept, however, this determinacy of the subjectivity is <i>one-sided</i> and, indeed, <i>for it</i> [the purpose] <i>itself</i>, since all determinacy has posited itself as sublated in it. Thus, too, for it [the purpose] the presupposed object is only an ideal, <i>in itself vacuous</i> reality. As this contradiction of its identity with itself opposite the negation and the opposition posited in it, it is itself the sublating, the <i>activity</i> of so negating the opposition that it posits it as identical with itself. This is the <i>process of realizing the purpose</i> in which, by rendering itself something other than its subjectivity and objectifying itself, it has sublated the difference of both, has joined <i>itself</i> together <i>only with itself</i> and has <i>preserved</i> itself. </div> <div class="remark">The concept of purpose is, on the one hand, superfluous; on the other hand, it is rightly labelled <i>a concept of reason</i> and contrasted with the understanding's abstract-universal that relates itself to the particular (which it does not have in itself) only <i>by way of subsuming it</i>. – Furthermore, the difference of the purpose as the <i>final cause</i> from the merely <i>efficient cause</i> (i.e. what is ordinarily called the cause) is of the utmost importance. The cause pertains to the not yet uncovered, blind necessity; for this reason it appears to pass over into its other and lose its originality in it in the course of being posited. Only in itself or for us is the cause in the effect first a cause, and does it come back <i>into itself</i>. The purpose, by contrast, is posited as <i>in itself</i> the determinacy, or what there [in efficient causality] still appears as being-other contains the effect [here], so that, in its efficacy, it does not pass over [into something else] but instead <i>preserves itself</i>. That is to say, it brings about itself alone and is, in the <i>end</i>, what it was in the <i>beginning</i>, in the original state. What is truly original is so only by means of this self-preservation. – The purpose requires a speculative construal, as the concept that itself, in its own <i>unity</i> and in the <i>ideality</i> of its determinations, contains the <i>judgment</i> or the negation, the opposition of the subjective and the objective, and is equally the sublating of them.</div> <div class="remark">With regard to the purpose, one should not immediately or should not merely think of the form in which it is in consciousness, as a determination on hand in the representation. Through the concept of <i>inner</i> purposiveness, Kant re-awakened the idea in general and that of life in particular. Aristotle's determination of life already contains the inner purposiveness and thus stands infinitely far beyond the concept of modern teleology which has only the <i>finite</i>, the <i>external</i> purposiveness in view.</div> <div class="remark">Need and drive are the examples of purpose lying closest at hand. They are the <i>felt</i> contradiction that takes place <i>within</i> the living subject itself and they enter into the activity of negating this negation that is still mere subjectivity. The <i>satisfaction</i> produces the peace between the subject and object, in that the objective dimension standing <i>over there</i> [<i>drüben</i>] in the still on hand contradiction (to the need) is equally sublated with respect to this, its one-sidedness, through the unification with the subjective dimension. – Those who speak so much of the solidity and invincibility of the finite have an example of the opposite in every drive. The drive is, so to speak, the <i>certainty</i> that the subjective dimension is only one-sided and has just as little truth as the objective dimension. The drive is, furthermore, the <i>implementation</i> [<i>Ausführung</i>] of this, its certainty. It manages to sublate this opposition – that the subjective dimension would be and remain only something subjective, just as the objective dimension would equally be and remain only something objective – and [to sublate] this finitude of them.</div> <div class="remark">With regard to the activity of the purpose, attention may also be drawn to the fact that, in the <i>syllogism</i> that conjoins the purpose with itself through the means of the realization, the <i>negation</i> of the <i>termini</i> surfaces – the just mentioned negation of immediate subjectivity that surfaces in the purpose as such, like that of the <i>immediate</i> objectivity (of the means and the presupposed objects). This is the same negation that is exercised in the elevation of the spirit to God in contrast to the finite things of the world as much as in contrast to one's own subjectivity. This is the moment which (as mentioned in the <i>Introduction</i> and in § 192) is overlooked and left aside in the form of the syllogisms at the level of the understanding, the form that is given to this elevation in the so-called proofs of God's existence.</div> <h6 id="s205">§205</h6> <div>The teleological relation in its immediacy is initially the <i>external</i> purposiveness, and the concept is opposite the object which is something <i>presupposed</i>. The purpose is thus <i>finite</i>, partly in terms of the <i>content</i>, partly in terms of the fact that it has an external condition in an extant object as the <i>material</i> of its realization. To this extent, its self-determination is merely <i>formal</i>. The immediacy entails, more precisely, that the <i>particularity</i> (as <i>a determination of form</i>, the <i>subjectivity</i> of the purpose) appears as reflected in itself, the <i>content</i> as <i>distinct</i> from the <i>totality</i> of the form, the subjectivity <i>in itself</i>, the concept. This diversity constitutes the <i>finitude</i> of the purpose <i>within itself</i>. The content is, by this means, as limited, contingent, and given as the object is something particular and extant. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. When speaking of purpose, one usually has one's eye only on external purposiveness. In this manner of considering things, they do not count as bearing their determination in themselves. Instead they count merely as <i>means</i> that are used and used up to realize some purpose lying outside them. This is in general the viewpoint of <i>utility</i>, which formerly played a great role in the sciences as well, but then deservedly came to be discredited, and recognized to be insufficient for true insight into the nature of things. To be sure, justice must be done to finite things as such inasmuch as they are to be considered to be other than ultimate and to point beyond themselves. This negativity of finite things, however, is their own dialectic and, in order to know this, one first has to get involved with their positive content. Moreover, what is at stake in the case of the teleological manner of consideration is the well-intended interest of pointing out the wisdom of God announcing itself in nature. To this extent, accordingly, it should be noted that, with this search for purposes that things serve as means, one does not get beyond the finite and easily lapses into meagre reflections, as, for example, when not only is the grapevine considered from the viewpoint of the familiar use that it affords human beings, but even the cork tree is so considered in relation to the stopper that is cut from its bark in order to seal the wine bottle. In former times, entire books have been written in this vein and it is easy to establish that neither the true interest of religion nor that of science can be advanced in this way. The external purposiveness stands immediately before the idea, but sometimes what thus stands on the threshold is precisely more insufficient than anything else.</div> <h6 id="s206">§206</h6> <div>The teleological relation is the syllogism in which the subjective purpose joins itself together [<i>sich…zusammenschließt</i>] with the objectivity external to it through a middle term [<i>Mitte</i>] that is the unity of the two, both as the <i>purposive activity</i> and as the objectivity <i>immediately</i> posited under the purpose, the <i>means</i> [<i>Mittel</i>]. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The development of the purpose into the idea comes about by way of three steps: <i>first</i>, that of the subjective purpose; <i>second</i>, that of the purpose bringing itself about [<i>sich vollführenden</i>]; and <i>third</i>, that of the purpose that has brought itself about. – At the outset we have the subjective purpose and this, as the concept being for itself, is itself the totality of the conceptual moments. The first of these moments is that of the universality identical with itself: as it were, the neutral first water in which everything is contained but not yet separated out. The second is then the particularization of this universal, through which it receives a determinate content. But since this determinate content is posited by the activity of the universal, the latter then returns to itself by means of that content and <i>joins itself together with itself</i> [<i>schließt sich mit sich selbst zusammen</i>]. Accordingly, when we set a purpose in front of us, we also say that we decide [<i>beschließen</i>] on something and accordingly consider ourselves at the outset to be, as it were, open and amenable to this or that determination. Similarly then, however, it is also said that 'one has resolved [<i>entschlossen</i>] to do something', which expresses that the subject has emerged from his inwardness, i.e. his being only for himself, and let himself in for the objectivity standing opposite him. This then yields the progression from the merely subjective purpose to the purposive activity directed outwards.</div> <h6 id="s207">§207</h6> <div>1. The <i>subjective</i> purpose is the syllogism in which the <i>universal</i> concept joins together with individuality by means of particularity, such that this [individuality] as the self-determination <i>judges</i>. That is to say, this individuality both particularizes that still indeterminate universal, making it a determinate <i>content</i>, and also posits the <i>opposition</i> of subjectivity and objectivity. It [this individuality] is, in itself, at the same time the return into itself since it determines the concept's subjectivity (presupposed as something opposite the objectivity) to be deficient in relation to the totality that has joined together with itself and since at the same time it thereby turns <i>outward</i>.</div> <h6 id="s208">§208</h6> <div>2. This <i>activity turned outward</i> is the <i>individuality</i> that, in the subjective purpose, is identical to the particularity in which, next to the content, the <i>external objectivity is</i> also <i>included</i>. As such, this activity relates at the outset <i>immediately</i> to the object and takes control of it as a <i>means</i>. The concept is this immediate <i>power</i> because it is the negativity identical with itself, in which the <i>being</i> of the object is thoroughly determined only as something <i>ideal</i> [<i>ideelles</i>]. – The <i>entire middle term</i> is now this inner power of the concept as <i>activity</i>, with which the <i>object</i> is immediately unified as <i>means</i> and under which it stands.</div> <div class="remark">In the finite purposiveness, the middle term is this status of being <i>broken</i> [<i>das Gebrochene</i>] into two moments external to one another, the activity and the object. The relation of the purpose as <i>power</i> to this object and the latter's being conquered by it is <i>immediate</i> – it is the <i>first premise</i> of the inference – insofar as in the concept qua ideality that is for itself the object is posited as <i>in itself</i> nothing. This relation or first premise <i>becomes itself the middle term</i> which is, at the same time, the syllogism <i>in itself</i>, since by means of this relation the purpose joins together its activity, in which it remains contained and dominant, with objectivity.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The process of carrying out the purpose is the mediated manner of realizing the purpose; just as necessary, however, is the immediate realization of it. The purpose seizes the object immediately because it is the power over the object, because in it the particularity is contained and, in the latter, the objectivity is also contained. – The living entity has a body; the soul takes control of it and has immediately objectified itself in it. The human soul has a great deal to do in making its corporeal condition a means. A human being must first take possession of his body, as it were, so that it may be the instrument of his soul.</div> <h6 id="s209">§209</h6> <div>3. The purposive activity with its means is still directed outward, since the purpose is also <i>not</i> identical with the object; thus it must first be mediated with the object. The means, as the object in this <i>second premise</i>, is <i>in immediate</i> relation with the <i>other</i> extreme of the syllogism, the objectivity as presupposed, the material. This relation is the sphere of the mechanism and chemism now <i>serving</i> the purpose that is their truth and free concept. That the subjective purpose, as the power of these processes in which the <i>objective dimension</i> rubs up against itself and sublates itself, keeps itself <i>outside them</i> and is what <i>preserves itself</i> in them – this is the <i>cunning</i> of reason. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. Reason is as <i>cunning</i> as it is <i>powerful</i>. The cunning consists generally in the activity of mediating, which, by letting the objects, in keeping with their own nature, act on one another and wear themselves out on one another, without meddling immediately in this process, achieves <i>its</i> purpose alone. In this sense, one can say that the divine providence, over against the world and its process, behaves as the absolute cunning. God gives free rein to human beings with their particular passions and interests and, by this means, what comes about is the accomplishment of <i>his</i> aims which are different from what was pursued by those of whom he makes use in the process.</div> <h6 id="s210">§210</h6> <div>Thus, the realized purpose is the <i>posited unity</i> of the subjective and the objective dimensions. This unity, however, is essentially determined in such a way that the subjective and objective dimensions are neutralized and sublated only with respect to their <i>one-sidedness</i>, while the objective dimension is subjected and made to conform to the purpose as the free concept and, thereby, to the power over it. The purpose <i>preserves</i> itself against and in the objective dimension because, in addition to being the <i>one-sided</i> subjective dimension (the particular), it is also the concrete universal, the identity of both, that is in itself [<i>die an sich seiende Identität beider</i>]. This universal, that as simple is reflected in itself, is <i>the content</i> that remains <i>the same</i> through all three <i>termini</i> [terms] of the syllogism and their movement.</div> <h6 id="s211">§211</h6> <div>In the finite purposiveness, however, the purpose carried out is also something as internally broken as was the middle term and the initial purpose. What has come about is thus only a form posited <i>externally</i> in the material found before it, a form that, on account of the restricted content of the purpose, is likewise a contingent determination. The purpose attained is thus only an object that is also in turn a means or material for other purposes and so on ad infinitum.</div> <h6 id="s212">§212</h6> <div>What happens, however, in the process of realizing the purpose <i>in itself</i> is that <i>the one-sided subjectivity</i> and the semblance [<i>Schein</i>] of objective self-sufficiency on hand opposite it are sublated. In seizing the means, <i>the concept</i> posits itself as the object's essence as it is <i>in itself</i>; in the mechanical and chemical process, the self-sufficiency of the object has already evaporated <i>in itself</i> and in the course it takes under the dominance of the purpose, the <i>semblance</i> of that self-sufficiency, the negative dimension <i>opposite the concept</i>, sublates itself. Yet this object is immediately already posited as vacuous in itself, as only ideal by virtue of the fact that the executed purpose is determined <i>only</i> as means and material. With this, the opposition of <i>content</i> and <i>form</i> has vanished as well. Since the purpose, by sublating [<i>durch Aufhebung</i>] the formal determinations, joins itself together with itself, the form is posited as <i>identical</i> with itself, thus as content, so that the <i>concept</i> as the <i>activity of the form</i> has only <i>itself</i> as <i>content</i>. It is thus posited through this process generally what the <i>concept</i> of the purpose was: the unity, <i>being in itself</i>, of the subjective and the objective dimensions now posited <i>as being for itself – the idea</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The finitude of the purpose consists in the fact that, in the course of its realization, the material applied as means to it is only subsumed under it externally and made to conform to it. But, now, in fact the object <i>in itself</i> is the concept and because the concept, as purpose, is realized therein, this is only the manifestation of its own inner dimension. The objectivity is thus as it were only a hull under which the concept lies hidden. Within the finite, we cannot experience it or see that the purpose is truly attained. To accomplish the infinite purpose is thus merely to sublate the illusion [<i>Täuschung</i>] that it is not yet accomplished. The good, the absolute good, brings itself to completion in the world eternally and the result is that it is already brought to completion in and for itself, without needing first to wait for us. It is this illusion in which we live and at the same time it alone is the activating principle upon which the interest of the world rests. The idea in its process fabricates that illusion for itself, positing an other opposite itself, and its action consists in sublating this illusion. Truth emerges only from this error and herein lies the reconciliation with error and with finitude. Otherness or error, as something sublated, is itself a necessary moment of the truth, the truth which only is by making itself its own result.</div> <h2 id="HGL205">C. The idea</h2> <h6 id="s213">§213</h6> <div>The idea is the true <i>in and for itself</i>, <i>the absolute unity of the concept and objectivity</i>. Its ideal content is none other than the concept in its determinations. Its real [<i>reeller</i>] content is only its exhibition [<i>Darstellung</i>], an exhibition that it provides for itself in the form of external existence [<i>Dasein</i>] and, with this shape incorporated into the concept's ideality and in its power, the concept thus preserves itself in that exhibition.</div> <div class="remark">The definition <i>of the absolute</i>, that it is the <i>idea</i>, is itself absolute. All previous definitions go back to this one. – The idea is the <i>truth</i>; for the truth is this, that objectivity corresponds to the concept, – not that external things correspond to my representations; these are only <i>correct</i> representations that <i>I, this person</i> [<i>Ich Dieser</i>], have. In the idea it is not a matter of an indexical this [<i>Diesen</i>], it is a matter neither of representations nor of external things. – But <i>everything</i> actual, insofar as it is something true, is also the idea and possesses its truth only through and in virtue of the idea. The individual being is some side or other of the idea, but for this still other actualities are needed, actualities that likewise appear as obtaining particularly for themselves; the concept is realized only in them together and in their relation. The individual taken by itself [<i>für sich</i>] does not correspond to its concept; this limitation of its existence constitutes its <i>finitude</i> and its demise.</div> <div class="remark">The idea itself is no more to be taken as an idea <i>of something or other</i> than the concept is to be taken merely as a determinate concept. The absolute is the universal idea and the <i>one</i> idea that, by <i>judging</i>, particularizes itself into a <i>system</i> of determinate ideas: ideas, however, that are only this, the process of going back into the one idea, their truth. On the basis of this judgment, the idea is <i>at the outset</i> only the one, universal <i>substance</i>, but its developed, true actuality is that it is as <i>subject</i> and thus as spirit.</div> <div class="remark">The idea is frequently taken for something logical in a merely formal sense, insofar as it does not have some <i>concrete existence</i> [<i>Existenz</i>] as its point of departure and support. One must leave such a view to the standpoints for which the concretely existing thing and all further determinations that have not yet penetrated to the idea still count as so-called <i>realities</i> and true <i>actualities</i>. – Equally false is the representation of the idea as though it were only <i>something abstract</i>. It is this, of course, insofar as everything <i>untrue</i> is consumed in it. However, in itself it is essentially <i>concrete</i> since it is the free concept, the concept determining itself and thereby determining itself as reality. It would be something formally abstract only if the concept that is its principle were taken as the abstract unity and not as it is, namely, as the <i>negative return of it into itself</i> and as <i>subjectivity</i>.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. By truth, one understands at first that I <i>know</i> [<i>wisse</i>] how something <i>is</i>. Yet this is truth only in relation to consciousness or the formal truth, mere correctness. In contrast to this, truth in the deeper sense consists in this, that objectivity is identical with the concept. It is truth in this deeper sense that is at stake if, for example, one is speaking of a <i>true</i> state or of a <i>true</i> work of art. These objects [<i>Gegenstände</i>] are <i>true</i> if they are what they <i>should</i> be, that is to say, if their reality corresponds to their concept. So construed, the untrue is the same as what is otherwise also called 'the bad'. A bad human being is one who is not truly human, i.e. a human being who does not behave in keeping with the concept or determination of a human being. Nothing, meanwhile, can subsist utterly without the identity of the concept and reality. Even something bad and untrue <i>is</i> only insofar as its reality still behaves somehow in conformity with its concept. Something thoroughly bad or at odds with the concept is, precisely for this reason, something collapsing in itself. It is the concept alone through which things have their standing in the world; that is to say, in the language of religious representation, things are what they are only by virtue of the divine and thereby creative thought dwelling within them. – When speaking of the idea, one must not imagine something remote and other-worldly by this. The idea is instead what is thoroughly present, and so too it is to be found in every consciousness, even if muddled and stunted. – We represent the world to ourselves as an enormous totality created by God and, indeed, such that God has revealed himself to us in it. So too we regard the world as governed by divine providence and herein lies the fact that the asundered character [<i>Auseinander</i>] of the world is eternally led back to the unity out of which it went forth and, in keeping with that unity, is preserved. – From time immemorial in philosophy, it has been about nothing other than thoughtfully knowing the idea, and underlying everything that deserves the name 'philosophy' has been the consciousness of an absolute unity of what holds for the understanding only in its separation. – The proof that the idea is the truth is not something to be demanded only now; the entire foregoing elaboration and development of thinking contains this proof. The idea is the result of the course that this has taken, a course that is, nevertheless, not to be understood as if it were something <i>only</i> mediated, that is to say, mediated by something other than itself. The idea is instead its own result and, as such, just as much immediate as mediated. The stages considered so far, those of being and essence and equally of the concept and objectivity, are not something fixed and resting on themselves with regard to this difference among them. Instead they have been demonstrated to be dialectical and their truth is only that of being moments of the idea.</div> <h6 id="s214">§214</h6> <div>The idea can be grasped as <i>reason</i> (this is the genuine philosophical meaning of <i>reason</i>), further as <i>subject-object</i>, as the <i>unity of the ideal and the real, of the finite and the infinite, of the soul and the body</i>, as the <i>possibility that has its actuality in itself</i>, as that the <i>nature</i> of which <i>can only be conceived as existing</i>, and so forth, because in it [the idea] all relationships of the understanding are contained, but in their <i>infinite</i> return and identity in themselves. </div> <div class="remark">The understanding makes easy work of pointing out that everything said of the idea is <i>self-contradictory</i>. This can be equally conceded to it or rather it is already accomplished in the idea; – a work that is the work of reason and, of course, not as easy as that of the understanding. – The understanding shows that the idea is self-contradictory because, for example, the subjective dimension is only subjective and the objective dimension, by contrast, is opposed to it; because being is something completely different from the concept and thus cannot be plucked from it; similarly, because the finite is only finite and precisely the opposite of the infinite, and consequently is not identical with it and so on for all determinations. If the understanding thus shows that the idea is self-contradictory, the [science of] logic points out the opposite instead, namely, that the subjective dimension that is supposed to be merely subjective lacks any truth, contradicts itself, and passes over into its opposite, as does the finite that is supposed to be merely finite, the infinite that is supposed to be merely infinite, and so on. By this means, the process of passing over into its opposite and the unity in which the extremes are as something sublated, as a shining [<i>Scheinen</i>] or as moments, reveals itself as their truth.</div> <div class="remark">The understanding that tackles the idea suffers from a twofold misunderstanding. <i>In the first place</i>, it takes the <i>extremes</i> of the idea, however they may be expressed, insofar as <i>they</i> are <i>in their unity</i>, yet in the sense and determination proper to them insofar as they are <i>not</i> in their concrete unity but instead are still <i>abstractions</i> outside it. The understanding mistakes no less the <i>relation</i>, even if it is already posited explicitly. In this way the understanding overlooks, for example, the nature of the <i>copula</i> in a judgment, which asserts of the individual, the subject, that the individual is just as much something not individual but instead something universal. – <i>In the second place</i>, the understanding holds <i>its</i> reflection that the idea that is identical with itself contains the <i>negative</i> of itself (that it contains the contradiction) to be an <i>external</i> reflection, that does not fall to the idea itself. In fact, however, this is not a wisdom proper to the understanding. The idea is instead itself the dialectic that eternally separates and distinguishes what is identical with itself from the differentiated [<i>Differenten</i>], the subjective from the objective, the finite from the infinite, the soul from the body and, only insofar as it does, is it eternal creation, eternally alive, and eternal spirit. Because it is thus itself the passing over or rather the transposing of itself into <i>abstract understanding</i>, it is also eternally <i>reason</i>. It [i.e. the idea] is the dialectic that takes what is understandable in this [superficial] way [<i>dieses Verständige</i>] – including the diversity of its finite nature and the false semblance [<i>falschen Schein</i>] of self-sufficiency of its productions – and renders it understandable in a recursive way [<i>wieder verständigt</i>] and leads it back to unity. Since this twofold movement is neither temporal nor separate and distinct in any way – otherwise it would be again only abstract understanding –, it is the process of eternally intuiting [<i>Anschauen</i>] itself in the other; the concept that <i>has</i> carried <i>itself</i> out in its objectivity, the object that is <i>inner purposiveness</i>, essential subjectivity.</div> <div class="remark">The <i>diverse ways</i> of construing the idea, as unity of the ideal and the real, of the <i>finite</i> and <i>infinite</i>, of <i>identity</i> and <i>difference</i> [<i>Differenz</i>], and so on, are more or less <i>formal</i>, since they designate some sort of stage of the <i>determinate concept</i>. Only the concept itself is free and the truly <i>universal</i>; in the idea its <i>determinacy</i> is thus equally only itself, – an objectivity into which it, as the universal, continuously sets itself and in which it has only its own determinacy, the total determinacy. The idea is the <i>infinite judgment</i>, each of the sides of which is the self-sufficient totality and, precisely by virtue of completing itself to this end [<i>dazu</i>], has just as much passed over into the other. None of the other determinate concepts is this totality completed in its two sides, except the <i>concept</i> itself and the <i>objectivity</i>.</div> <h6 id="s215">§215</h6> <div>The idea is essentially a <i>process</i> since its identity is that of the absolute and free concept only insofar as it is the absolute negativity and thus dialectical. It is the course [<i>Verlauf</i>] in which the concept as the universality that is individuality determines itself to be objectivity and to be the opposite of objectivity, and in which this externality that has the concept as its substance leads itself back into <i>subjectivity</i> through its immanent dialectic.</div> <div class="remark">Because the idea is (a) a <i>process</i>, the expression 'the <i>unity</i> of the finite and infinite, of thinking and being, and so on', as an expression for the absolute, is false, as often noted. For this unity expresses an abstract, <i>calmly</i> enduring identity. The expression is likewise false because the idea is (b) <i>subjectivity</i>, since that unity expresses the <i>in-itself</i>, the <i>substantial dimension</i> of the true unity. The infinite thus appears as only <i>neutralized</i> relative to the finite, and so too the subjective relative to the objective, thinking relative to being. But in the <i>negative</i> unity of the idea the infinite reaches over and beyond the finite, as does thinking over being, subjectivity over objectivity. The unity of the idea is subjectivity, thinking, infinity, and hence it is essentially distinct from the idea as <i>substance</i> just as this <i>overreaching</i> subjectivity (thinking, infinity) is to be distinguished from the <i>one-sided</i> subjectivity (one-sided thinking, one-sided infinity) to which it reduces itself in judging and making determinations.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The idea, as a process, runs through three stages in its development. The first form of the idea is <i>life</i>, i.e. the idea in the form of immediacy. The second form is then that of the mediation or the difference [<i>Differenz</i>], and this is the idea as <i>knowing</i> which appears in the twofold shape of the <i>theoretical</i> and the <i>practical</i> idea. The process of knowing has, as its result, the restoration of the unity, enriched by the difference, and this yields the third form of the hereby <i>absolute idea</i>, the final stage of the logical process that proves itself to be at once the truly first and the only entity that is through itself alone.</div> <h3 id="HGL206">a. Life</h3> <h6 id="s216">§216</h6> <div>The <i>immediate</i> idea is <i>life</i>. The concept is realized as the soul in a <i>body</i>; the soul is the immediate, self-referring <i>universality</i> of the body's externality just as much as it is the body's <i>particularization</i>, so that the body expresses no other differences than the determination of the concept, and finally it is the <i>individuality</i> as infinite negativity – the dialectic of the body's objectivity, [the factors of which are] outside one another, an objectivity that is led back into subjectivity from the semblance of self-sufficient subsistence, so that all members are reciprocally momentary <i>means</i> as much as momentary purposes, while life, inasmuch as it is the <i>inceptive</i> particularization, <i>results</i> in itself as the <i>negative</i> unity that is <i>for itself</i> and, in the dialectic of embodiment [<i>Leiblichkeit</i>], joins itself together only with itself. – Life is thus essentially <i>a living entity</i> [<i>Lebendiges</i>] and, with regard to its immediacy, <i>this individual</i> living entity. In this sphere, finitude has the determination that soul and body are <i>separable</i>, on account of the immediacy of the idea; this constitutes the mortality of the living. But those two sides of the idea are diverse <i>component parts</i> [<i>Bestandstücke</i>] only insofar as it is dead. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The individual members of the body are what they are only by means of their unity and in relation to it. Thus, for example, a hand that is severed from the body, is a hand only in name, but not in reality [<i>der Sache nach</i>], as <i>Aristotle</i> already noted. – From the standpoint of the understanding, life is usually regarded as a mystery and generally as <i>incomprehensible</i>. In this way, meanwhile, the understanding merely confesses its finitude and vacuousness. Life is, in fact, so little something incomprehensible that in it we are confronted with the concept itself and, more precisely, the <i>immediate</i> idea existing concretely as a concept. With this, then, the deficiency of life is also at once articulated. This deficiency consists in the fact that here concept and reality do not truly correspond to one another. The concept of life is the soul and this concept has the body for its reality. The soul is, as it were, poured into its corporality and thus the former is only <i>sensing and feeling</i> [<i>empfindend</i>] but not yet freely being-for-itself. The process of life consists then in overcoming the immediacy in which it is still caught up, and this process (which is itself in turn threefold) has as its result the idea in the form of the judgment, i.e. the idea as <i>knowing</i>.</div> <h6 id="s217">§217</h6> <div>The living is the syllogism, whose moments are systems and syllogisms in themselves (§§ 198, 201, 207) which, however, are active syllogisms, processes, and in the subjective unity of the living, they are only <i>one</i> process. The living is thus the process of its coming to closure together with itself [<i>Zusammenschließens mit sich selbst</i>], that runs its course by means of <i>three processes</i>.</div> <h6 id="s218">§218</h6> <div>1. The first is the process of the living <i>within</i> itself, in which it divides itself in itself and makes its corporal condition [<i>Leiblichkeit</i>] its object, its <i>inorganic</i> nature. For its part, this inorganic side, as the relatively external, enters into the difference and opposition of its moments that reciprocally surrender themselves, the one assimilating the other to itself, and preserve themselves in the process of producing themselves. This activity of the members, however, is only one activity of the subject, the activity into which its productions go back, so that through that activity only the subject is produced, i.e. it merely reproduces itself. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The process of living that is internal to it has in nature the threefold form of sensibility, irritability, and reproduction. As sensibility, the living is immediately a simple relation to itself, the soul that is everywhere present, in its body, the external juxtapositions of which have no truth for it. As irritability, the living appears divided in itself and, as reproduction, the living is constantly reproducing itself from the inner difference of its members and organs. The living <i>is</i> only as this continually self-renewing process within itself.</div> <h6 id="s219">§219</h6> <div>2. But the <i>judgment</i> of the concept proceeds freely to release from itself the <i>objective dimension</i> as a self-sufficient totality. The negative relation of the living to itself, as <i>immediate</i> individuality, <i>presupposes</i> an inorganic nature standing over against it. Since this negative aspect of itself is just as much a moment of the concept [<i>Begriffsmoment</i>] of the living itself, it is thus in the latter (the at once concrete universality) as a <i>lack</i>. The dialectic, through which the object as something <i>in itself</i> vacuous sublates itself, is the activity of the living entity certain of itself that accordingly <i>preserves, develops</i>, and <i>objectifies</i> itself in <i>this process opposite</i> an <i>inorganic nature</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The living stands over against an inorganic nature towards which it behaves as its power and which it assimilates to itself. The result of this process is not, as in the case of the chemical process, a neutral product in which the self-sufficiency of both sides standing opposite one another is sublated. Instead, the living demonstrates itself to be something that reaches over and beyond its other [<i>übergreifend über sein Anderes</i>] which is incapable of withstanding its power. The inorganic nature that is subjugated by the living endures this because it is <i>in itself</i> the same as life is <i>for itself</i>. Hence, in the other, the living is merely connecting with itself. When the soul has fled the body, the play of the elementary powers of objectivity commences. These powers are, so to speak, continually poised to initiate their process in the organic body, and life is the constant battle against them.</div> <h6 id="s220">§220</h6> <div>3. In the initial stage of its process, the living individual behaves as a subject and concept in itself. Through its second stage, it assimilates its external objectivity to itself and thus <i>posits in itself</i> the real determinacy. As a result, it is now <i>in itself the genus</i>, substantial universality. The particularization of the latter is the relation of the subject to <i>another subject</i> of its genus and the judgment is the relationship of the genus to these determinate individuals standing opposite one another: <i>the difference of the sexes</i> [<i>Geschlechtsdifferenz</i>].</div> <h6 id="s221">§221</h6> <div>The process of the <i>genus</i> brings this [genus] to the point of <i>being-for-itself</i>. Because life is still the immediate idea, the product of the process breaks down into two sides. On the <i>one</i> side, the living individual in general, at first presupposed as immediate, emerges now as something <i>mediated</i> and <i>produced</i>. On the <i>other</i> side, however, the living <i>individuality</i> that, on account of its initial <i>immediacy</i>, behaves <i>negatively</i> towards the universality, <i>perishes</i> in this [universality] as the power. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. What is alive dies because it is the contradiction of being <i>in itself</i> the universal, the genus, and yet existing concretely and immediately only as individual. In death, the genus demonstrates itself to be the power over the immediately individual. – For the animal, the process of the genus is the highest point of its condition of being alive. But the animal does not manage to be for itself in its genus, succumbing instead to the latter's power. What is immediately alive mediates itself with itself in the process of the genus and thus elevates itself above its immediacy, only to sink back down to that same immediacy again and again. In this way, life runs its course at first merely into the bad infinity of the progression ad infinitum. What, meanwhile, in keeping with the concept, comes about through the process of life is the sublation and overcoming of the immediacy in which the idea as life is still ensnared.</div> <h6 id="s222">§222</h6> <div>By this means, however, the idea of life has not only freed itself from <i>just any</i> (particular) <i>immediate</i> 'this', but from this initial immediacy altogether. In this way, it comes <i>to itself</i>, to its <i>truth</i>, entering <i>into concrete existence</i> [<i>Existenz</i>] as the <i>free genus for itself</i>. The death of the merely immediate, individual living thing [<i>Lebendigkeit</i>] is the <i>spirit emerging</i>.</div> <h3 id="HGL207">b. Knowing [Das Erkennen]</h3> <h6 id="s223">§223</h6> <div>The idea concretely exists freely <i>for itself</i> insofar as universality is the element <i>in which it exists concretely</i> or insofar as it is objectivity itself as the concept; [that is to say,] the idea has itself for an object [<i>Gegenstand</i>]. Its subjectivity, determined as universality, is <i>pure differentiating within</i> it – intuiting that keeps itself in this identical universality. But, as a differentiating in a determinate way, it is the further <i>judgment</i> of thrusting itself as a totality away from itself and, indeed, initially <i>presupposing</i> itself as the <i>external universe</i>. These are two judgments that are <i>in themselves</i> identical but not yet <i>posited</i> as identical.</div> <h6 id="s224">§224</h6> <div>The relation of these two ideas that are identical <i>in themselves</i> or as life, is thus the <i>relative</i> relation that makes up the determination of <i>finitude</i> in this sphere. It is the <i>relationship of reflection</i>, since the differentiation of the idea in it [the idea] itself is only the <i>first</i> judgment, the <i>presupposing</i> is not yet <i>a positing</i>, and thus, for the subjective idea, the objective dimension is the <i>extant</i> immediate world or the idea as life in the appearance of <i>individual concrete existence</i>. At the same time, insofar as this judgment is a pure differentiating <i>within</i> it [the idea] itself (see the preceding section), the idea is <i>for itself</i> both itself and <i>its other</i>. Thus it is the <i>certainty</i> of being <i>in itself</i> the identity of this objective world with it. – Reason comes to the world with the absolute faith in its capacity to posit the identity and elevate its certainty to <i>truth</i>, and with the drive to posit as also vacuous <i>for it</i> that opposition that is <i>in itself</i> vacuous.</div> <h6 id="s225">§225</h6> <div>In general, this process is <i>knowing</i> [<i>das Erkennen</i>]. In it, in <i>one</i> activity, the opposition, the one-sidedness of subjectivity together with the one-sidedness of objectivity, is sublated <i>in itself</i>. But this process of sublating takes place at the outset only <i>in itself</i>. The process as such is thus itself immediately beset with the finitude of this sphere and falls apart into the <i>twofold</i>, diversely posited movement of the drive. [In one respect,] it is the drive to sublate the one-sidedness of the <i>subjectivity</i> of the idea by taking up into itself the world <i>that is</i> [<i>seiende Welt</i>], taking it up into subjective representing and thinking, and to fill out the abstract certainty of itself with this objectivity as <i>content</i>, an objectivity that thus counts as true. Conversely, it is the drive to sublate the <i>one-sidedness</i> of the objective world that here accordingly, by contrast, counts as a <i>semblance</i>, a collection of contingencies and shapes vacuous in themselves, and to determine and mould it through the <i>inner dimension</i> of the subjective, that counts here as the objective, as what truly is. The former is the drive of knowledge [<i>Wissen</i>] to truth, <i>knowing</i> [<i>Erkennen</i>] as <i>such</i>, the <i>theoretical</i> [activity]; the latter is the drive of the <i>good</i> to bring itself about, <i>willing</i>, the <i>practical</i> activity of the idea.</div> <h4 id="HGL208">α. Knowing</h4> <h6 id="s226">§226</h6> <div>The universal finitude of knowing that lies in the first judgment, the <i>presupposition</i> of the opposition (§ 224), which its very action contradicts, specifies itself more precisely in its own idea in this direction, that its moments receive the form of diversity from one another and, since those moments are in fact complete, they come to stand in the relationship of reflection, not of the concept, to one another. The assimilation of the material [<i>Stoffes</i>] as something given thus appears as a <i>way of taking it up</i> into conceptual determinations that at the same time remain <i>external</i> to it, determinations that likewise display themselves opposite one another as diverse. It is reason active as <i>understanding</i>. The truth that this knowing comes to is thus likewise only <i>finite</i>; the infinite truth of the concept is fixed as a goal that is only <i>in itself</i>, something <i>beyond</i> this knowing. But in its external action, it stands under the guidance of the concept, and conceptual determinations make up the inner thread of the progression. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The finitude of knowing lies in the presupposition of a world already found before it, and in the process the knowing subject appears as a <i>tabula rasa</i>. This representation of things has been ascribed to Aristotle, although no one is more removed from this external way of construing knowing than Aristotle. This knowing does not yet know [<i>weiß</i>] itself as the activity of the concept, something which it is only <i>in itself</i>, but not <i>for itself</i>. Its behaviour appears to it as something passive, yet it is in fact active.</div> <h6 id="s227">§227</h6> <div>Because it presupposes <i>what is differentiated</i> as a being that is found to be already on hand, standing opposite it (the manifold <i>facts</i> of external nature or of consciousness), finite knowing has (1) the <i>formal identity</i> or the <i>abstraction</i> of universality as the form of its activity at the outset. This activity thus consists in dissolving the given concrete dimension, individuating its differences, and giving them the form of <i>abstract universality</i>; or in leaving the concrete dimension as the <i>ground</i> and, through abstraction from the particularities that seem inessential, extracting a concrete universal, the <i>genus</i> or the force and the law. Such is the <i>analytic method</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. It is customary to speak of <i>analytic</i> and <i>synthetic</i> method as though following the one or the other were a mere matter of our whim. Yet this is in no way the case. Instead, which of the two methods to apply – both of which result from the concept of finite knowing – depends upon the form of the objects [<i>Gegenstände</i>] themselves that are to be known. Knowing is at the outset analytical. The object has for it the shape of an isolated individual [<i>Gestalt der Vereinzelung</i>] and the activity of analytic knowing aims at tracing the individual lying before it back to a universal. Here thinking has the meaning of abstraction or formal identity only. This is the standpoint on which <i>Locke</i> and all empiricists stand. Many say that knowing can do nothing further than analyse the given, concrete objects [<i>Gegenstände</i>] into their abstract elements and then consider the latter in isolation. It is immediately evident, meanwhile, that this is to turn things upside down and that the sort of knowing that wants to take things as they <i>are</i> thereby falls into self-contradiction. Thus, for example, the chemist brings a piece of meat to his test-tube, breaks it down in a variety of ways, and then says that he has found that it consists of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and so on. However, these abstract bits of material are then no longer meat. Something similar is the case when the empirical psychologist analyses an action into the diverse sides which it presents for consideration and then clings to them in abstraction from one another. In this case, the analytically treated object [<i>Gegenstand</i>] is regarded, as it were, as an onion from which one peels one skin after the other.</div> <h6 id="s228">§228</h6> <div>This <i>universality</i> is (2) also a <i>determinate</i> one. The activity here proceeds according to the moments of the concept that, in finite <i>knowing</i>, is not in its infinity but is the <i>understandable</i> [<i>verständige</i>], <i>determinate concept</i> instead. Taking up the object [<i>Gegenstand</i>] into the forms of the latter concept is the <i>synthetic method</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The movement of the synthetic method is the inversion of the analytic method. While the latter advances by going from the individual as its starting point to the universal, in the former case the universal (as <i>definition</i>) forms the point of departure instead, and there is a progression from it through the particularization (in the <i>division</i>) to the individual (the <i>theorem</i>). With this, the synthetic method demonstrates itself to be the development of the moments of the concept in the object [<i>Gegenstand</i>].</div> <h6 id="s229">§229</h6> <div>(aa) Knowing initially puts the object [<i>Gegenstand</i>] into the form of the determinate concept in general so that, by this means, its <i>genus</i> and its universal <i>determinacy</i> are posited. The respective object is the <i>definition</i>. Its material and justification are procured by the analytic method (§ 227). The determinacy is, nevertheless, supposed to be only a <i>characteristic</i> [<i>Merkmal</i>], that is to say, something to assist merely subjective knowing that is external to the object [<i>Gegenstand</i>]. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The definition itself contains the three moments of the concept: the universal as the proximate genus (<i>genus proximum</i>), the particular as the determinacy of the genus (<i>qualitas specifica</i>), and the individual as the defined object [<i>Gegenstand</i>] itself. With respect to definition, the question immediately arises 'where does it comes from?' and this question is generally to be answered by noting that definitions arise on the analytic path. With this answer, however, the dispute about the correctness of the definitions put forward immediately presents itself. For it is a matter here of the perceptions that formed one's point of departure and the kinds of viewpoint from which one looked. The richer the object [<i>Gegenstand</i>] is that is to be defined, i.e. the more diverse sides it offers for consideration, the more diverse the definitions given of it tend to be. Thus, for example, there is an entire array of definitions of life, of the state, and so forth. Geometry, by contrast, has an easy time making definitions since its object, space, is such an abstract object [<i>Gegenstand</i>]. – Further, there is generally no necessity on hand with respect to the content of the defined object [<i>Gegenstand</i>]. One is supposed to accept that there is space, that there are plants, animals, and so forth, and it is not a matter for geometry, botany, and so forth to point out the necessity of the defined objects [<i>Gegenstände</i>]. On account of this circumstance, the synthetic method is no more appropriate for philosophy than the analytic method is, since philosophy has, before anything else, to justify to itself the necessity of its objects [<i>Gegenstände</i>]. Nevertheless, the effort has been made over and over to make use of the synthetic method in philosophy. Spinoza in particular begins with definitions and says, for example, 'Substance is the <i>causa sui</i>.' He lays down the most speculative themes in his definitions, but in the form of assurances. The same holds for Schelling.</div> <h6 id="s230">§230</h6> <div>(bb) The account of the second moment of the concept, the determinacy of the universal as <i>particularization</i>, is given by the <i>division</i> in terms of some sort of external aspect. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. What is demanded of the division is that it be complete, and part of this requirement is a principle or ground of the division that is so constituted that the division based on it encompasses the entire scope of the domain designated by the definition in general. In the course of the division it is then necessary, in addition, that it be done in such a way that its principle has been drawn from the nature of the object [<i>Gegenstand</i>] itself that is divided up. In this way the division is made naturally and not artificially, i.e. arbitrarily. So, for example, in zoology in the division of mammals, the claws and teeth are used above all as the ground of the division, and this is sensible since mammals themselves distinguish themselves from one another through these parts of their bodies and the general type of the diverse classes of them [i.e. mammals] are to be led back to this. – In general, the true division is to be regarded as determined by the concept. To this extent it is initially threefold; but since the particularity presents itself as something doubled, the division then progresses to something fourfold as well. Trichotomies predominate in the sphere of the spirit and it is one of Kant's accomplishments to have drawn attention to this circumstance.</div> <h6 id="s231">§231</h6> <div>(cc) In the <i>concrete individuality</i> (such that the simple determinacy in the definition is construed as <i>a relationship</i>), the object [<i>Gegenstand</i>] is a synthetic relation of <i>differentiated</i> determinations – a <i>theorem</i>. Because they are diverse, their identity is a <i>mediated</i> identity. The process of supplying the material that constitutes the middle members is the <i>construction</i>; and the mediation itself, out of which the necessity of that relation for knowing goes forth, is the <i>proof</i>. </div> <div class="remark">According to the usual accounts given of the difference between the synthetic and the analytic method, it appears on the whole arbitrary which one person might want to use. If the concrete dimension that is presented in the synthetic method as the <i>result</i> is <i>presupposed</i>, then the abstract determinations may be analysed as its <i>consequences</i> (those abstract determinations constituting <i>presuppositions</i> and <i>material</i> for the proof). The algebraic <i>definitions</i> of curved lines are <i>theorems</i> in the route taken by geometry. Similarly, analysis of the Pythagorean theorem, assumed as the definition of a right-angled triangle, would yield principles proven earlier in geometry for the sake of establishing it. The arbitrariness of the choice rests upon the fact that the one method like the other proceeds from something <i>externally presupposed</i>. As far as the nature of the concept is concerned, analysing is primary since it first has to elevate the given, empirically concrete material into the form of universal abstractions which can only then be put forward as definitions in the synthetic method.</div> <div class="remark">That these methods, so essential and so splendidly successful in their distinctive fields, are not usable for knowing philosophically is self-evident, since they have presuppositions and since knowing behaves in them as understanding, proceeding in terms of formal identity. In the case of Spinoza who principally employed the geometric method and, indeed, for <i>speculative</i> concepts, the formalism of the method makes itself immediately apparent. The Wolffian philosophy that develops it to the extremes of pedantry is a metaphysics of the understanding even in terms of its content. – The abuse of the formalism of these methods in philosophy and the sciences has been replaced in more recent times with the abuse of so-called <i>construction</i>. Kant brought into circulation the notion that mathematics <i>constructs</i> its <i>concepts</i>, which was to say nothing else than that it dealt, <i>not</i> with <i>concepts</i> but instead with abstract determinations of <i>sensory intuitions</i>. Accordingly, what has been labelled a <i>construction of concepts</i> is the process of giving an account of <i>sensory</i> determinations taken up from <i>perception</i> while circumventing the concept, and the further formalism of classifying philosophical and scientific objects [<i>Gegenstände</i>] according to a presupposed schema in the form of tables (doing so, moreover, at one's whim and discretion). Lying in the background here is probably an obscure representation of the <i>idea</i>, of the unity <i>of the concept and of objectivity</i> as well as the notion that the idea is concrete. But that play of the so-called process of construction is far removed from presenting this <i>unity</i> that only the <i>concept</i> as such is, and the sensory-concrete [content] of intuition is just as far from being a concrete [content] of reason and the idea.</div> <div class="remark">Since, moreover, <i>geometry</i> has to deal with the <i>sensory</i> but <i>abstract intuition</i> of space, it can specify unrestrictedly simple determinations of the understanding in space. For this reason, it alone has the synthetic method of finite knowing in its perfection. Nevertheless, it is quite noteworthy that, following this course, geometry ultimately hits upon <i>incommensurabilities</i> and <i>irrationalities</i> where, if it wants to go further in its determinations, it is driven beyond the principle of mere understanding. As often happens elsewhere, so here, too, the terminology is inverted such that what is named <i>rational</i> is something <i>due to the understanding</i> [<i>Verständige</i>], but what is called <i>irrational</i> is much more a beginning and trace of <i>what is in keeping with reason</i> [<i>Vernünftigkeit</i>]. Other sciences, since they do not find themselves in the simple framework of space or time, come up against the limit of proceeding by merely understanding (which happens to them both necessarily and often) but they have an easy way of helping themselves out of this fix. They break up the consistency of that way of proceeding and take what they need, often the opposite of what went before, taking it in from the outside, from representation, opinion, perception, or whatever it may be. In its obliviousness to the nature of its method (and that method's relation to the content) this finite knowing is precluded from knowing that, in its progression through definitions, divisions, and so forth, it is guided by the necessity of <i>the conceptual determinations</i>. Nor does this obliviousness allow it to know either where it is at its limit or, if it has overstepped that limit, that it finds itself in a field where the determinations of understanding no longer count, determinations that it nevertheless roguishly continues to use in that field.</div> <h6 id="s232">§232</h6> <div>The <i>necessity</i> which finite knowing produces in a <i>proof</i> is initially an external necessity, determined only for the subjective discernment. But in the necessity as such, it has itself left behind its presupposition and point of departure, the <i>finding</i> and <i>givenness</i> of its content. The necessity as such is, in itself, the concept relating itself to itself. The subjective idea has thus, in itself, come to what is determined in and for itself, <i>what is not given</i>, and is thus <i>immanent</i> to it as the <i>subject</i>. As such, it passes over into the <i>idea</i> of <i>willing</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The necessity that knowing attains through the proof is the opposite of what forms for it its point of departure. In its point of departure, knowing had a given and contingent content. Now, however, at the conclusion of its movement, it knows [<i>weiß</i>] the content as a necessary one and this necessity is mediated by the subjective activity. So, too, subjectivity was at first completely abstract, a mere <i>tabula rasa</i>, whereas it proves itself now, by contrast, to be determining. Herein, however, lies the transition from the idea of knowing to the idea of willing. This transition consists then, more precisely, in the fact that the universal is to be construed in its truth as subjectivity, as the self-moving, active concept, positing determinations.</div> <h4 id="HGL209">β. Willing</h4> <h6 id="s233">§233</h6> <div>The subjective idea – as what is determinate in and for itself, the simple, self-same <i>content</i> – is the <i>good</i>. Its drive of realizing itself inverts the relationship that holds relative to the idea of the <i>true</i>, and is bent on determining, in terms of its <i>purpose</i>, the world that it finds. – This <i>willing</i> is, on the one hand, certain of the <i>vacuousness</i> [<i>Nichtigkeit</i>] of the presupposed object but, on the other hand, as finite, it at the same time presupposes both the purpose of the good as a merely <i>subjective</i> idea and the <i>independence</i> of the object.</div> <h6 id="s234">§234</h6> <div>The finitude of this activity is thus the <i>contradiction</i> that, in the self-contradicting determinations of the objective world, the <i>purpose of the good</i> is both carried out and not carried out, and that it is posited as something inessential just as much as something essential, as something actual and at the same time as merely possible. This contradiction presents itself as the <i>endless progression</i> in the actualization of the good, that is therein established merely as an <i>ought</i>. <i>Formally</i>, however, this contradiction disappears in that the activity sublates the subjectivity of the purpose and thereby the objectivity, the opposition through which both are finite, and not only the one-sidedness of <i>this</i> subjectivity but subjectivity in general; <i>another</i> such subjectivity, that is to say, a <i>new</i> generation of the opposition, is not distinct from what was supposed to be an earlier one. This return into itself is at the same time the <i>recollection</i> [<i>Erinnerung</i>] of the <i>content</i> into itself, which is the <i>good</i> and the identity in itself [<i>die an sich seiende Identität</i>] of both sides, – the recollection of the presupposition of the theoretical stance (§ 224), that the object is what is substantial in itself and true. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. While what matters for intelligence is merely taking the world as it <i>is</i>, the will, by contrast, is bent on making the world what it <i>ought</i> to be. The immediate, what it finds before it, counts for the will, not as a fixed being, but instead only as a semblance [<i>Schein</i>], as something in itself vacuous. Here those contradictions come to the fore in which one stumbles around on the standpoint of morality. This in general is the standpoint of the <i>Kantian</i> and even also the <i>Fichtean</i> philosophy in a practical context [<i>Beziehung</i>]. The good is supposed to be realized; one has to work to produce it, and the will is only the good activating itself. But then, were the world as it is supposed to be, the activity of willing would fall by the wayside. Thus the will in itself requires that its purpose also not be realized. This account correctly expresses the will's finitude. But then we should not stand pat with this finitude, and it is the process of willing itself through which this finitude and the contradiction contained in it are sublated. The reconciliation consists in the fact that the will, in its result, returns to the presupposition of knowing, that is to say, it consists in the unity of the theoretical and practical idea. The will knows [<i>weiß</i>] the purpose as its own and the intelligence construes the world as the actual concept. This is the true posture of rational knowing. What is vacuous and vanishing makes up only the surface, not the genuine essence of the world. This is the concept, being in and for itself, and the world is thus itself the idea. The unsatisfied striving disappears if we know that the final purpose of the world has been brought about and to the same degree eternally brings itself about. This is generally the posture of the adult man, while the youth believes that the whole world is in a bad way and out of it a completely different world must be made. By contrast, religious consciousness regards the world as governed by Divine Providence, and thus as corresponding to what it <i>ought</i> to be. This correspondence of is and ought, meanwhile, is not a frozen and inert correspondence; for the good, the final purpose of the world, <i>is</i> only in that it produces itself again and again, and the difference between the spiritual world and the natural world then consists in the fact that while the latter constantly only returns into itself, a progression also takes place in the former.</div> <h6 id="s235">§235</h6> <div>The <i>truth</i> of the good is, by this means, <i>posited</i> as the unity of the theoretical and practical idea, [the notion] that the good has been attained in and for itself – that the objective world is thus in and for itself the idea precisely as it [the idea] at the same time eternally posits itself as <i>purpose</i> and through activity produces its actuality. This life, having come back to itself from the differentiation [<i>Differenz</i>] and finitude of knowing, and having become identical with the concept through the activity of the concept, is the <i>speculative or absolute idea</i>.</div> <h3 id="HGL2010">c. The absolute idea</h3> <h6 id="s236">§236</h6> <div>The idea as the unity of the subjective and the objective idea is the concept of the idea, for which the idea as such is the object [<i>Gegenstand</i>], for which it is the object [<i>Objekt</i>] – an object [<i>Objekt</i>] into which all determinations have gone together. This unity is accordingly the <i>absolute and entire truth</i>, the idea thinking itself, and here, indeed, <i>as</i> thinking, as the <i>logical</i> idea. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The absolute idea is first the unity of the theoretical and the practical idea and, by this means, at the same time the unity of the idea of life and the idea of knowing. In knowing [<i>Erkennen</i>], we had the idea in the form of difference [<i>Differenz</i>] and the process of knowing has presented itself to us as the overturning of this difference and as the restoration of that unity which, as such and in its immediacy, is first the idea of life. The deficiency of [the concept of] life consists in being at first only the idea insofar as it is <i>in itself</i> [<i>die an sich seiende Idee</i>]; in contrast to this, but in just as one-sided a fashion, knowing is only the idea insofar as it is <i>for itself</i>. The unity and truth of these two is the <i>idea</i> insofar as it is <i>in</i> and <i>for itself</i> and, thereby, <i>absolute</i>. – Up to now <i>we</i> have had for our object [<i>Gegenstand</i>] the idea in the development through its diverse stages; now, however, the idea is objective with respect to itself [<i>sich selbst gegenständlich</i>]. This is the <img alt="" src="EPL-006.jpg"/> what Aristotle already designated as the highest form of the idea.</div> <h6 id="s237">§237</h6> <div>The <i>absolute idea</i> is for itself, since in it there is no transition or presupposing and no determinacy at all that is not fluid and transparent; it is the <i>pure form</i> of the concept that intuits <i>its content</i> as itself. It is <i>content</i> for itself insofar as it is the ideal differentiating of itself from itself, and one side of what has been differentiated is the identity with itself, in which, however, the totality of the form is contained as the system of the determinations of the content. This content is the system of <i>the logical</i>. Nothing remains here of the idea, as <i>form</i>, but the <i>method</i> of this content – the determinate knowledge [<i>Wissen</i>] of the validity of its moments. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. When one speaks of the absolute idea, one can think that here finally the substantive must come to the fore, that here everything must become clear. One can, to be sure, vacuously spout on end about the absolute idea; the true content, meanwhile, is nothing but the entire system, the development of which we have considered up to this point. It can accordingly also be said that the absolute idea is the universal, but the universal not merely as an abstract form opposite which the particular content stands as something other than it. Instead it is the absolute form, into which all determinations, the entire fullness of the content posited by it, have gone back. In this respect, the absolute idea is comparable to the old man who says the same religious sentences as the child does, but for the old man they have the meaning of his entire life. Even if the child understands the religious content, what validity that content has for him is still of the sort that lies outside his entire life and world. – The same holds then also for human life in general and the occurrences that make up the content of it. All work is only aimed at the goal, and if this is attained, then one is astonished at finding nothing else than precisely this, what one wanted. The interest lies in the entire movement. If a human being pursues his life, then the end can appear to him as quite limited, but it is the entire <i>decursus vitae</i> [course of a life] that is encompassed in it. – Thus, too, then the content of the absolute idea is the entire expanse of what we had before us up until now. The final [point] is the insight that the entire unfolding makes up the content and interest. – This is, furthermore, the philosophical view that everything that appears limited, taken for itself, acquires its worth through inhering in the whole and being a moment of the idea. Thus it is that we have had the content and what we still have is the knowledge [<i>Wissen</i>] that the content is the living development of the idea and this simple retrospective is contained in the form. Each of the stages considered up to this point is an image of the absolute, albeit in a limited manner at first, and so it drives itself on to the whole, the unfolding of which is precisely what we have designated the method.</div> <h6 id="s238">§238</h6> <div>The moments of the speculative method are (α) the <i>beginning</i>, which is being or the immediate; for itself for the simple reason that it is the beginning. From the vantage point of the speculative idea, however, it is the speculative idea's <i>self-determining</i> which, as the absolute negativity or movement of the concept, <i>judges</i> and posits itself as the negative of itself. <i>Being</i>, which from the vantage point of the beginning as such appears as abstract affirmation, is thus instead the <i>negation</i>, <i>positedness</i>, being-mediated in general and being <i>pre</i>-supposed. But as the negation of the <i>concept</i> that is simply identical with itself in its otherness and is the certainty of itself, it is the concept not yet posited as concept or, in other words, it is the concept <i>in itself</i>. – For that reason, as the still undetermined concept, i.e. the concept determined only in itself or immediately, this being is just as much the <i>universal</i>.</div> <div class="remark">The beginning is taken in the sense of immediate being from intuition and perception – the beginning of the <i>analytic</i> method of finite knowing; in the sense of the universality, it is the beginning of the synthetic method of such knowing. Since, however, the logical [dimension] is immediately something universal as much as something that is [<i>Seiendes</i>], just as much something presupposed by the concept as it is immediate, its beginning is as much synthetic as it is analytic.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The philosophical method is as much analytic as it is synthetic, yet not in the sense of a mere juxtaposition or a mere oscillation of these two methods of finite knowing. It is instead such that it contains them as sublated in itself and accordingly behaves in each of its movements both analytically and synthetically at the same time. Philosophical thinking proceeds analytically insofar as it merely takes up its object [<i>Gegenstand</i>], the idea, giving the latter full play, and as it were merely looking upon its movement and development. To this extent, philosophizing is completely passive. But philosophical thinking is then equally synthetic and demonstrates itself to be the activity of the concept itself. This requires, however, the strenuous effort of holding off on one's own notions [<i>Einfälle</i>] and particular opinions which are always trying to assert themselves.</div> <h6 id="s239">§239</h6> <div>(β) The <i>progression</i> is the posited <i>judgment</i> of the idea. The immediate universal, as the concept in itself, is the dialectic of reducing, within itself, its immediacy and universality to a moment. It is accordingly the <i>negative</i> [aspect] of the beginning or the first [moment] posited in its <i>determinacy</i>; it is <i>for something</i> [<i>für eines</i>], the <i>relation</i> of what has been differentiated, – <i>the moment of reflection</i>.</div> <div class="remark">This progression is just as much <i>analytic</i> (in that the immanent dialectic only posits what is contained in the immediate concept) as <i>synthetic</i> (since in this concept this difference was not yet posited).</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. In the progression of the idea, the beginning demonstrates itself to be what it is in itself, namely, something posited and mediated and not what simply and immediately is [<i>nicht als das Seiende und Unmittelbare</i>]. Only for immediate consciousness is nature the beginning point [<i>Anfängliche</i>] and the immediate, and the spirit something mediated by nature. In fact, however, nature is posited by the spirit and the spirit itself makes nature its presupposition.</div> <h6 id="s240">§240</h6> <div>The abstract form of the progression within the stage of being is [to be] an <i>other</i> and a <i>passing over</i> into an other; in the stage of the essence, it is <i>the shining [das Scheinen] in something opposite</i>; in the stage of the concept, it is the differentiated status of the <i>individual</i> from the <i>universality</i> which <i>continues</i> itself as such in what is differentiated from it and is <i>as an identity</i> with the latter.</div> <h6 id="s241">§241</h6> <div>In the second sphere, the concept at first being in itself came to shine forth [<i>zum Scheinen gekommen</i>] and is <i>thus in itself</i> already the <i>idea</i>. – The development of this sphere becomes the return to the first, just as the development of the first sphere is a transition into the second. Only by means of this double movement is justice done to the difference, since each of the two differentiated factors, each considered in itself, completes itself so as to form the totality and, in that totality, puts itself into unity with the other. Only the fact that <i>both</i> sublate [<i>das Sichaufheben</i>] the one-sidedness <i>in themselves</i> prevents the unity from becoming one-sided.</div> <h6 id="s242">§242</h6> <div>The second sphere develops the relation of what has been differentiated into what the relation is at first, namely a <i>contradiction</i> in the relation itself – in the <i>infinite progression</i>. This contradiction (γ) resolves itself into the <i>end</i>, where the differentiated [<i>das Differente</i>] is posited as what it is in the concept. It is the negative of the first, and, as the identity with the latter, the negativity of itself. Hence, it is the unity in which these first two, as ideal and as moments, are sublated, i.e. preserved at the same time. The concept, starting out from its <i>being-in-itself</i>, thus comes to a close with itself by means of its difference [<i>Differenz</i>] and the process of sublating that difference. This concept is the <i>realized</i> concept, i.e. the concept that contains the <i>positedness</i> of its determinations in its <i>being-for-itself</i> – it is the <i>idea</i> for which, as the absolutely first (in the method), this end is at the same time nothing more than the process by which the <i>semblance</i> that the beginning is something immediate and it [the idea] a result <i>vanishes</i>; – in other words, this end is the knowledge that the idea is the one totality.</div> <h6 id="s243">§243</h6> <div>In this way, the method is not an external form but the soul and concept of the content, from which it is distinguished only insofar as the moments of the <i>concept</i>, even in <i>themselves</i>, in their [respective] <i>determinacy</i>, come to appear as the totality of the concept. Insofar as this determinacy or the content, with the form, leads itself back to the idea, this idea exhibits itself as the <i>systematic</i> totality which is only <i>one</i> idea, the particular moments of which are <i>in themselves</i> this same idea to the same extent that they bring forth the simple <i>being-for-itself</i> of the idea through the dialectic of the concept. – The science concludes in this way by grasping the concept of itself as the pure idea, for which the idea is.</div> <h6 id="s244">§244</h6> <div>The idea, which is <i>for itself</i>, <i>considered</i> in terms of this, its <i>unity</i> with itself, is <i>the process of intuiting</i> [<i>Anschauen</i>] and the idea insofar as it intuits is <i>nature</i>. As intuiting, however, the idea is posited by external reflection in a one-sided determination of immediacy or negation. Yet the absolute <i>freedom</i> of the idea is that it does not merely pass over into <i>life</i> or let life shine in itself as finite knowing, but instead, in the absolute truth of itself, <i>resolves to release</i> freely <i>from itself</i> the moment of its particularity or the first determining and otherness, the <i>immediate idea</i>, as its <i>reflection</i> [<i>Widerschein</i>], itself as <i>nature</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. We have now returned to the concept of the idea with which we began. This return to the beginning is at the same time a move forward [<i>Fortgang</i>]. What we began with was being, the abstract being, and now we have the <i>idea</i> as <i>being</i>; this idea insofar as it <i>is</i> [<i>diese seiende Idee</i>], however, is <i>nature</i>.</div> <div id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ10877"><a href="part0020.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ13628">27</a> Translators' note: 'Object' here and in the remainder of the text is always a translation of <i>Objekt</i>; when 'object' is a translation of <i>Gegenstand</i>, it is so flagged.</div> </body>
