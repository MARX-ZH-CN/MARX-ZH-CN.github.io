<body id="page_233"> <h1 id="HGL191">Third subdivision of the Logic: The doctrine of the concept</h1> <h6 id="s160">§160</h6> <div>The concept is the <i>free</i> [actuality] [<i>das Freie</i>], as the <i>substantial power that is for itself</i>, and it is the <i>totality</i>, since <i>each</i> of the moments is <i>the whole</i> that <i>it</i> is, and each is posited as an undivided unity with it. So, in its identity with itself, it is what is <i>determinate in and for itself</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The standpoint of the concept is in general that of absolute idealism, and philosophy is knowing conceptually [<i>begreifendes Erkennen</i>]. It is conceptual knowing insofar as everything that ordinary consciousness regards as an entity, and in its immediacy as independent, is known [<i>gewußt</i>] merely as an ideal moment in it. In logic at the level of the understanding [<i>Verstandeslogik</i>] the concept is usually considered as a mere form of thinking and, more precisely, as a universal representation. The claim, so often repeated from the side of sentiment and the heart, that concepts as such are something dead, empty, and abstract, refers to this low-level construal of the concept. Meanwhile, just the opposite holds and the concept is instead the principle of all life and thereby, at the same time, something absolutely concrete. That such is the case has emerged as the result of the entire logical movement up to this point and hence does not need first to be proven here. As far as the opposition of form and content is concerned in this connection, namely, with respect to the concept as allegedly merely formal, this opposition, like all the other oppositions held fast by reflection, is already behind us as something overcome dialectically, that is to say through itself, and it is precisely the concept which contains all the earlier determinations of thinking as sublated determinations in itself. To be sure, the concept needs to be considered as form, but only as infinite, fecund form that encompasses the fullness of all content within itself and at the same time releases it from itself. By the same token, the concept may also be called 'abstract', if by 'concrete' one understands what presents itself to the senses as concrete – what can be perceived in any immediate way at all. We cannot grasp the concept as such with our hands and, when it comes to the concept, we generally have to take leave of seeing and hearing. Nonetheless, the concept is at the same time, as already noted, the absolutely concrete, and indeed is so insofar as it contains in itself being and essence, and accordingly contains the entire richness of these two spheres in an ideal [<i>ideeller</i>] unity. – If, as previously noted, the diverse stages of the logical idea can be considered as a series of definitions of the absolute, then the definition of the absolute that is the result for us here is that the absolute is the <i>concept</i>. To be sure, one must in this case then construe the concept in a sense different from and higher than occurs in logic at the level of the understanding, for which the concept is regarded merely as a form of our subjective thinking, a form devoid of content in itself. In light of this, there is only one question that could still be raised. If in speculative logic 'concept' has a meaning completely different from the one that would otherwise be ordinarily associated with the expression, why is what is completely different in this sense [<i>dieses ganz Andere</i>] nonetheless called the 'concept' here, when doing so occasions misunderstanding and confusion? The reply to such a question would be that, however great the distance between the concept of formal logic and the speculative concept, it still turns out, on closer inspection, that the profounder meaning of the concept is by no means as alien to the ordinary use of language as might at first seem to be the case. One speaks of the derivation of a content, such as, for example, the derivation of legal determinations concerning property from the concept of property, and one speaks also conversely of tracing such a content back to the concept. With this, however, it is recognized that the concept is not merely a form devoid of content in itself, since, on the one hand, there would be nothing to derive from the latter and, on the other, in tracing a given content back to the empty form of the concept, the content would not only be robbed of its determinacy; it would also not be known.</div> <h6 id="s161">§161</h6> <div>The way the concept proceeds is no longer passing over or shining in an other. It is instead <i>development</i> since what are differentiated are at the same time immediately posited as identical with one another and with the whole, each being the determinacy that it is as a free being [<i>ein freies Sein</i>] of the whole concept. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. Passing over into an other is the dialectical process in the sphere of <i>being</i> and the process of shining in an other within the sphere of <i>essence</i>. The movement of the <i>concept</i> is, by contrast, the <i>development</i>, by means of which that alone is posited that is already on hand in itself. In nature it is the organic life, which corresponds to the stage of the concept. Thus, for example, the plant develops itself out of its seed. This seed contains the entire plant in itself already, but in an ideal manner and so one should not construe its development as if the various parts of the plant, root, stem, leaves, and so forth were already <i>really</i> in the seed yet merely in utterly miniature fashion. This is the so-called 'Chinese box hypothesis', the deficiency of which consists in the fact that what is only on hand initially in an ideal manner is considered as already concretely existing. What is right in this hypothesis is, by contrast, this: that the concept, in its process, remains with itself and that nothing new is posited by this means with respect to the content. Instead only an alteration of form is brought forth. It is then, too, this nature of the concept (that of demonstrating itself in its process as self-development) that one has one's eyes on when one speaks of ideas innate to human beings or considers all learning, as Plato did, merely as recollection. Yet this likewise should not be understood as if what makes up the content of the consciousness educated by instruction were already on hand previously in the same consciousness in the specific way that that content unfolds. – The movement of the concept is to be considered, as it were, merely as a play; the other posited by it is in fact not an other. In the Christian religious doctrine, this is articulated in such a way that God not only created a world that as an other stands over against him, but also that he has, from all eternity, produced a son in whom he is with himself as spirit.</div> <h6 id="s162">§162</h6> <div>The doctrine of the concept is divided into the doctrine of (1) the subjective or <i>formal</i> [<i>formellen</i>] concept, (2) the concept as determined to immediacy, or the <i>objectivity</i>, (3) the <i>idea</i>, the subject-object [<i>Objekt</i>], the unity of the concept and objectivity, the absolute truth. </div> <div class="remark"><i>Ordinary logic</i> apprehends only matters in themselves that surface here as a <i>part</i> of the <i>third</i> part of the whole and, in addition, the so-called 'laws of thinking' (that surfaced earlier) and, in applied logic, some from the sort of knowing bound up with material that is still psychological, metaphysical, and otherwise empirical, since those forms of thinking in the end no longer sufficed for it. Nonetheless, this science thereby lost any solid orientation. – Moreover, those forms that pertain at least to the genuine domain of logic are taken merely as determinations of conscious thinking and, indeed, conscious thinking at the level merely of the understanding, not of reason.</div> <div class="remark">The preceding logical determinations, the determinations of being and essence, are not mere determinations of thought, to be sure. In their process of passing over (the dialectical moment), and in their return into themselves and in their totality, they have proven themselves to be <i>concepts</i>. But they are (compare §§ 84 and 112) merely <i>determinate</i> concepts, concepts in themselves or, what is the same, concepts <i>for us</i> since the <i>other</i> (into which each determination <i>passes over</i> or in which it <i>shines</i> and is accordingly something relative) is determined not as something <i>particular</i>. Nor is the third factor determined as something <i>individual</i> or as a <i>subject</i>, which is to say that the identity of the determination is not <i>posited</i> in the determination opposite it, that its freedom is not posited, since it is not <i>universality</i>. – What is usually understood by '<i>concepts</i>' are determinations of understanding, even merely universal <i>representations</i>, hence, in general, <i>finite</i> determinations (compare § 62).</div> <div class="remark">The logic of the concept is usually understood as a merely formal [<i>formelle</i>] science, revolving around the <i>form</i> as such of the concept, the judgment, and the syllogism, but not at all around whether something is <i>true</i>; this depends, to the contrary, completely on the <i>content</i> alone. Were the logical forms of the concept actually dead, ineffective, and indifferent receptacles of representations or thoughts, then familiarity with them would be a <i>historical record</i> that is quite superfluous and dispensable for the truth. In fact, however, as forms of the concept, they are, to the contrary, <i>the living spirit of the actual</i>, and what is true of the actual is <i>true</i> only <i>by virtue</i> of these forms, <i>through them</i>, and <i>in them</i>. However, the truth of these forms for themselves, let alone their necessary connection, has never been considered and investigated until now.</div> <h2 id="HGL192">A. The subjective concept</h2> <h3 id="HGL193">a. The concept as such</h3> <h6 id="s163">§163</h6> <div>The <i>concept</i> as such contains the moments of <i>universality</i> (as the free sameness with itself in its determinacy), <i>particularity</i> (the determinacy in which the universal remains the same as itself, unalloyed), and <i>individuality</i> (as the reflection-in-itself of the determinacies of universality and particularity, the negative unity with itself that is the <i>determinate in and for itself</i> and at the same time identical with itself or universal).</div> <div class="remark">The individual is the same as the actual, with the difference that the former has gone forth from the concept and is accordingly <i>posited</i> as universal, as the negative identity with itself. Because it is first only <i>in itself</i> or <i>immediately</i> the <i>unity</i> of the essence and concrete existence [<i>Existenz</i>], the <i>actual</i> [<i>das Wirkliche</i>] <i>can</i> be productive [<i>wirken</i>]. But the individuality of the concept is simply <i>what produces</i> [<i>schlechthin das Wirkende</i>] and, indeed, no longer as the <i>cause</i> with the semblance [<i>mit dem Scheine</i>] of producing an other, but as what produces <i>its very self</i>. – The individuality, however, is not to be taken in the sense of only <i>immediate</i> individuality in terms of which we speak of individual things, human beings. This determinate sense of individuality surfaces first in the case of judgment. While each moment of the concept is itself the entire concept (§ 160), individuality, the subject, is the concept <i>posited</i> as the totality.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 1</i>. When there is talk of concepts, one usually has in view an abstract universality and the concept would then also be customarily defined as a universal representation. One accordingly speaks of colour, plant, animal, and so forth, and these concepts are supposed to arise by way of the fact that, in the process of leaving aside the particular factor through which the diverse colours, plants, animals, and so forth are distinguished from one another, we hold fast to what is common to them. This is the manner in which the understanding construes the concept and it is right for sentiment [<i>Gefühl</i>] to declare such concepts to be hollow and empty, mere schemata and shadows. But the universal factor of the concept is not merely something common, opposite which the particular has its standing for itself. Instead the universal factor is the process of particularizing (specifying) itself and remaining in unclouded clarity with itself in its other. It is of the most enormous importance as much for knowing as for our practical comportment that the merely common is not confused with the truly universal factor [<i>Allgemeinen</i>], the universal [<i>Universellen</i>]. All the reproaches that tend to be raised from the standpoint of sentiment against thinking in general, and then, more particularly, against philosophical thinking, are grounded in this confusion, as is the often-repeated claim about the dangerousness of thinking, allegedly driven to extremes. Moreover, in its true and encompassing meaning, the universal is a thought, of which it has to be said that it cost millennia before entering into human consciousness and which attained full recognition only through Christendom. The Greeks, who were otherwise so highly cultivated, knew neither God in his true universality nor even the human being. The Greek gods were only the particular powers of the spirit, and the universal God, the God of nations, was still the hidden God for the Athenians. So, too, for the Greeks there was an absolute chasm between them and the barbarians, and the human being as such was not yet recognized in his infinite worth and his infinite justification. When, indeed, the question has been posed why slavery has disappeared in modern Europe, first the one and then the other particular circumstance is cited to explain this phenomenon. The true reason why there are no longer slaves in Christian Europe is to be sought in nothing other than the principle of Christendom itself. The Christian religion is the religion of absolute freedom, and only for the Christian is the human being as such valid, in his infiniteness and universality. What the slave lacks is the recognition of his personhood; the principle of personhood, however, is the universality. The master regards the slave not as a person but as a basic matter [<i>Sache</i>] devoid of a self, and the slave himself does not count as an 'I'; instead, the master is his 'I'. – The previously mentioned difference between the merely common and the truly universal is articulated in Rousseau's well-known <i>Contrat social</i> in a quite fitting manner where it is said that the laws of a state would have to proceed from the universal will (<i>volonté générale</i>) without, however, needing at all to be the will <i>of all</i> (<i>volonté de tous</i>). In relation to the theory of the state, Rousseau would have accomplished something more thorough, had he always kept this distinction in mind. The universal will is the <i>concept</i> of the will and the laws are the particular determinations of the will, grounded [<i>begründet</i>] in this concept.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 2</i>. In regard to the usual discussion in logic [operating] at the level of the understanding, about the emergence and formation of concepts, it remains to be noted that <i>we</i> do not form the concepts at all and that the concept in general is not to be considered something that has a genesis at all. To be sure, the concept is not merely being or the immediate; instead, mediation is also part of it. However, this mediation lies in the concept itself, and the concept is what mediates itself through itself and with itself. It is wrong to assume, first that there are objects which form the content of our representations and then our subjective activity comes along behind them, forming the concepts of objects by means of the earlier mentioned operation of abstracting and gathering together what is common to the objects. On the contrary, the concept is what is truly first and the things are what they are, thanks to the activity of the concept dwelling in them and revealing itself in them. In our religious consciousness this surfaces in such a way that we say, 'God created the world out of nothing' or, to put it otherwise, 'the world and finite things have gone forth out of the fullness of divine thoughts and divine decrees'. In this manner it is recognized that the thought and, more precisely, the concept is the infinite form or the free, creative activity, which is not in need of some stuff on hand outside itself, in order to realize itself.</div> <h6 id="s164">§164</h6> <div>The concept is what is utterly <i>concrete</i> since the negative unity with itself (as being-determined-in-and-for-itself which is the individuality) itself makes up its relation to itself, the universality. To this extent, the moments of the concept cannot be detached from one another; the determinations of reflection <i>are supposed</i> to be grasped and to be valid each for itself, detached from the opposed determination. Since, however, their <i>identity</i> is <i>posited</i> in the concept, each of its moments can be immediately grasped only on the basis of and with the others. </div> <div class="remark">Taken in an abstract sense, universality, particularity, and individuality are the same as identity, difference, and ground. But the universal is what is identical with itself <i>explicitly in the sense</i> that at the same time the particular and the individual are contained in it. Furthermore, the particular is what has been differentiated or the determinacy, but in the sense that it is universal in itself and as an individual. Similarly, the individual has the meaning of being the <i>subject</i>, the foundation which contains the genus and species in itself and is itself substantial. This is the <i>posited</i> inseparability of the moments in their difference (§ 160), – the <i>clarity</i> of the concept in which no difference interrupts or obscures the concept, but in which each difference is instead equally transparent.</div> <div class="remark">There is nothing said more commonly than that the concept is something <i>abstract</i>. This is correct in part insofar as its element is thinking generally and not the empirically concrete sphere of the senses, in part insofar as it is not yet the <i>idea</i>. In this respect, the subjective concept is still <i>formal</i> [<i>formell</i>], yet not at all as if it should respectively have or acquire some other content than itself. – As the absolute form itself, the concept is every <i>determinacy</i>, but as it is in its truth. Thus, although the concept is at the same time abstract, it is what is concrete [<i>das Konkrete</i>] and, indeed, the absolutely concrete [<i>das schlechthin Konkrete</i>], the subject as such. The absolutely concrete [<i>das Absolut-Konkrete</i>] is the spirit (see the note to § 159), – the concept insofar as it <i>concretely exists</i> as concept, differentiating itself from its objectivity which, despite the differentiating, remains the concept's <i>own</i> objectivity. Everything else concrete, as rich as it may be, is not so inwardly identical with itself and, for that reason, in itself not as concrete, least of all what one commonly understands by the concrete, a manifold externally held together. – What are also called concepts and, to be sure, determinate concepts, e.g. human being, house, animal, and so forth, are simple determinations and abstract representations, – abstractions that, taking only the factor of universality from the concept while omitting the particularity and individuality, are thus not developed in themselves and accordingly abstract precisely from the concept.</div> <h6 id="s165">§165</h6> <div>The moment of <i>individuality</i> first <i>posits</i> the moments of the concept as differences, since it is the concept's negative reflection-in-itself. Thus it is <i>initially</i> the free differentiating of the concept as the <i>first negation</i>, by means of which the <i>determinacy</i> of the concept is posited, but posited as <i>particularity</i>. That is to say, first, that the moments differentiated have the determinacy of conceptual moments only opposite one another and, second, that their identity (that the one is the other) is equally <i>posited</i>. This <i>posited</i> particularity of the concept is the <i>judgment</i>. </div> <div class="remark">The usual species of <i>clear</i>, <i>distinct</i>, and <i>adequate</i> concepts pertain, not to the concept, but to psychology insofar as, by 'clear and distinct concepts', <i>representations</i> are meant, where 'clear' means an abstract, simply determinate representation and 'distinct' the sort of representation in which a <i>distinguishing mark</i> [<i>Merkmal</i>], i.e. some sort of determinacy has been singled out as a sign for <i>subjective</i> knowing. Nothing is so much the distinguishing mark of the externality and decay of logic than the cherished category of the <i>distinguishing mark</i>. The <i>adequate</i> concept is more of a play on the concept, indeed even the idea, but still expresses nothing but the formal aspect [<i>das Formelle</i>] of the agreement of a concept or even a representation with its object [<i>Objekt</i>], some external thing. – Underlying the so-called <i>subordinate</i> and <i>coordinate</i> concepts is [a] the concept-less difference between the universal and the particular as well as [b] their relatedness in an external reflection. An enumeration of species of <i>contrary</i> and <i>contradictory</i>, <i>affirmative</i>, <i>negative</i> concepts and so forth is, moreover, nothing other than a process of arbitrarily reading off determinacies of thought that for their part belong to the sphere of being or essence, where they have already been considered, and that have nothing to do with the determinacy of the concept itself as such. – The genuine differences of the concept – the universal, particular, and individual – constitute <i>species</i> of the concept, if at all only insofar as they are held apart from one another by external reflection. – The immanent differentiating and determining of the concept is on hand in the <i>judgment</i>, since the judging is the determining of the concept.</div> <h3 id="HGL194">b. The judgment</h3> <h6 id="s166">§166</h6> <div>The <i>judgment</i> is the concept in its particularity as the differentiating <i>relation</i> of its moments, which are posited as being for themselves and, at the same time, as identical with themselves, not with one another.</div> <div class="remark">In the case of a judgment one usually thinks first of the <i>self-sufficiency</i> of the extremes, subject and predicate, such that the subject is a thing or a determination for itself and the predicate, too, is a universal determination outside that subject, in my head somehow. I then bring the predicate together with the subject and, by this means, I judge. However, since the copula 'is' asserts the predicate of the subject, that external, subjective <i>subsuming</i> is sublated in turn and the judgment is taken as a determination of the <i>object</i> itself. – The <i>etymological</i> meaning of 'judgment' [<i>Urteil</i>] in our language is profounder and expresses the unity of the concept as what comes first [<i>das Erste</i>] and its differentiation as the <i>original</i> division [<i>Teilung</i>] that the judgment truly is.</div> <div class="remark">The abstract judgment is the sentence: 'the <i>individual</i> is the <i>universal</i>'. These are the determinations that the <i>subject</i> and <i>predicate</i> first have opposite one another, in that the moments of the concept are taken in their immediate determinacy or first abstraction. (The sentences 'the <i>particular</i> is the <i>universal</i>' and 'the <i>individual</i> is the <i>particular</i>' belong to the further determination of the judgment.) It has to be viewed as an amazing lack of attentiveness that in the logic books there is nowhere to be found [acknowledgment of] the fact that in <i>each</i> judgment one is articulating a sentence such as 'the individual is the universal' or, even more determinately, 'the subject is the predicate' (e.g. 'God is absolute spirit'). To be sure, the determinations – individuality and universality, subject and predicate – are also distinct, but on that account, nonetheless, the completely universal <i>fact</i> remains that each judgment asserts them as identical.</div> <div class="remark">The copula 'is' comes from the concept's nature, namely, to be <i>identical</i> with itself in its externalization. The individual and the universal, as <i>its</i> moments, are the sort of determinacies that cannot be isolated. The earlier determinacies of reflection, in their relationships, are <i>equally</i> related to one another, but their connection is only that of <i>having</i>, not <i>being</i>, the <i>identity posited as such</i> or the <i>universality</i>. For this very reason, the judgment is the true <i>particularity</i> of the concept, since it is the determinacy or differentiation of the same, a differentiation that, however, remains the universality.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The judgment is customarily regarded as a combination of concepts and, indeed, diverse sorts of concepts. What is right in this construal is this, that the concept forms the presupposition of the judgment and makes its appearance in the judgment in the form of the difference. But it is wrong to speak of diverse sorts of concepts, for the concept, although concrete, is still essentially <i>one</i> and the moments contained in it are not to be considered as diverse sorts. Moreover, it is equally false to speak of a <i>combination</i> of the sides of the judgment since, when there is talk of a combination, then what are combined are thought of as being on hand for themselves even apart from the combination. This external construal is evident then in an even more determinate fashion if it is said of a judgment that it comes about by virtue of the fact that a predicate is attributed to a subject. In this connection the subject counts as something obtaining externally for itself and the predicate as something occurring in our head. Meanwhile, the copula 'is' already contradicts this representation. If we say 'this rose <i>is</i> red' or 'this painting <i>is</i> beautiful', what is thereby said is not that it is <i>we</i> who in some external fashion make the rose red or the painting beautiful, but instead that these are the objects' own determinations. A further deficiency of the usual way of construing judgment (usual in formal logic) consists in the fact that, as a consequence of this construal, the judgment generally appears as something merely contingent and the progression from concept to judgment is not demonstrated. The concept as such, however, is not something in itself stagnant [<i>verharrend</i>], devoid of process, as the understanding thinks. To the contrary, as infinite form, it is absolutely active, as it were, the <i>punctum saliens</i> of all vitality, and accordingly differentiates itself from itself. This diremption posited by the concept's own activity, the diremption of the concept into the difference between its moments, is the <i>judgment</i>, the meaning of which is accordingly to be construed as the <i>particularization</i> of the concept. <i>In itself</i>, the concept is, to be sure, already the particular but, in the concept as such, the particular is not yet <i>posited</i>, but is instead still in transparent unity with the universal. Thus, for example, as earlier noted (§ 160 <i>Addition</i>), the seed of a plant already contains the particular factor of the root, of the branches, of the leaves, and so forth. But this particular factor is at first only on hand <i>in itself</i> and is only posited in that the seed discloses itself, something which is to be considered the judgment of the plant. This example can also serve to draw notice to the fact that neither the concept nor the judgment are merely occurrences in our head and are not fashioned merely by us. The concept is something that dwells within the things themselves, by means of which they are what they are, and to comprehend [<i>begreifen</i>] an object means accordingly to become conscious of its concept [<i>Begriff</i>]. If we then take the next step to judging the object, it is not our subjective doing that accounts for attributing this or that predicate to the object. Instead we consider the object in the determinacy posited by its concept.</div> <h6 id="s167">§167</h6> <div>Judgment is usually taken in the <i>subjective</i> sense as an <i>operation</i> and form that surfaces merely in <i>self-conscious</i> thinking. This difference, however, is not yet on hand in the logical [sphere, where] judgment is supposed to be taken in the completely universal sense: <i>all things are a judgment</i>, – i.e. they are <i>individuals</i> which are a <i>universality</i> or inner nature in themselves, or a <i>universal</i> that is <i>individuated</i>. The universality and individuality distinguish themselves in them [the things] but are at the same time identical. </div> <div class="remark">The sense of the judgment that is supposed to be merely subjective – as if it were <i>I</i> who <i>attributes</i> a predicate to a subject – is contradicted by the objective expression of the judgment: 'the rose <i>is</i> red', 'gold <i>is</i> metal', and so forth; <i>I</i> do not first attribute something to them. – Judgments are different from <i>sentences</i>; the latter contain the determination of the subjects that does not stand in a connection of universality with them – a condition, an individual action, and the like; 'Caesar was born in Rome in such and such a year, conducted the war in Gaul for ten years, crossed the Rubicon, and so forth' are sentences, not judgments. There is, furthermore, something quite empty in saying that sentences of the sort, e.g. 'I slept well last night' or even 'Present arms!' <i>can</i> be put into the form of judgments. A sentence like 'a carriage is passing by' would be a judgment and, to be sure, a subjective one only if it could be doubted whether what is moving by is a carriage or whether it is the object that is moving and not the standpoint from which we are observing it; where what then matters is finding the determination for a representation not properly determined yet.</div> <h6 id="s168">§168</h6> <div>The standpoint of the judgment is <i>finitude</i>, and from this standpoint the <i>finitude</i> of things consists in the fact that they are a judgment, that their existence [<i>Dasein</i>] and their universal nature (their body and their soul) are, certainly unified (otherwise the things would be nothing), but that these, their moments, are both already diverse and generally able to be separated.</div> <h6 id="s169">§169</h6> <div>In the abstract judgment 'the individual is the universal', the subject relates itself negatively to itself and, as such, is the immediately <i>concrete</i>, while the predicate is, by contrast, the <i>abstract</i>, indeterminate, the <i>universal</i>. But since they are joined by 'is', the predicate in its universality must also contain the determinacy of the subject and it [that determinacy] is the <i>particularity</i> and the latter is the <i>posited identity</i> of the subject and predicate. As thus indifferent to this difference of form, it is the <i>content</i>.</div> <div class="remark">Only in the predicate does the subject have its explicit determinacy and content; hence, taken by itself [<i>für sich</i>] it is a mere representation or a bare name. In the judgments '<i>God</i> is the supremely real' and so forth or 'the <i>absolute</i> is identical with itself' and so forth, 'God' and 'absolute' are mere names. What the subject <i>is</i>, is first said in the predicate. What it might otherwise also be as something concrete does not matter to <i>this</i> judgment (compare § 31).</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. If one says: 'The subject is that of which something is asserted and the predicate is what is asserted of it', then this is to say something quite trivial. One learns nothing more precise about the difference between the two by this means. As far as the thought of the subject is concerned, it is initially the individual and the predicate the universal. In the further development of the judgment, it then happens that the subject does not remain merely the immediately individual and the predicate merely the abstract universal. Subject and predicate then also acquire a [new] meaning, the former that of the particular and universal, the latter that of the particular and individual. This exchange in the meaning of the two sides of the judgment is what takes place under the two designations of 'subject' and 'predicate'.</div> <h6 id="s170">§170</h6> <div>As far as the more precise determinacy of subject and predicate is concerned, the <i>former</i>, as the negative relation to itself (§§ 163, 166 <i>Addition</i>), is the underlying fixity [<i>das Feste</i>] in which the predicate has its subsistence and is in an ideal way (it <i>inheres</i> in the subject). Moreover, since the subject is generally and <i>immediately</i> concrete, the determinate content of the predicate is only <i>one</i> of the <i>many</i> determinacies of the subject and the latter is richer and broader than the predicate.<br/>
Conversely, the <i>predicate</i>, as the universal subsisting for itself and indifferent to whether this subject is or not, goes beyond the subject, <i>subsumes</i> the subject under it, and is, for its part, broader than the subject. The <i>determinate content</i> of the predicate (see preceding section) alone makes up the identity of both.</div> <h6 id="s171">§171</h6> <div>Subject, predicate, and the determinate content or the identity [of them] are initially posited in the judgment, in their relation, as themselves <i>diverse</i>, falling outside one another. But <i>in themselves</i>, i.e. in terms of the concept, they are <i>identical</i>, since the concrete totality of the subject is this, not to be some sort of indeterminate manifold, but instead <i>individuality</i> alone, the particular and universal in an identity, and precisely this unity is the predicate (§ 170). – In the copula, furthermore, the <i>identity</i> of the subject and predicate is of course <i>posited</i> but initially only as the abstract 'is'. In keeping with this <i>identity</i>, the subject is also to be posited in the determination of the predicate, by means of which the latter also acquires the determination of the subject and the copula <i>is fulfilled</i>. This is the <i>further determination</i> of the judgment, by means of the copula full of content, into the <i>syllogism</i>. But first, in terms of the judgment, there is the further determination of it, the determining of the initially abstract, <i>sensory universality</i> into <i>a set of all</i> [<i>Allheit</i>], <i>genus</i>, and <i>species</i> and into the developed <i>universality of the concept</i>.</div> <div class="remark">Only knowledge of the further development of the judgment gives a <i>context</i> as well as a <i>sense</i> to what are customarily put forward as <i>species</i> of judgment. In addition to appearing completely contingent, the usual enumeration is superficial and even barren and wild in the presentation of the differences. In part, the manner in which positive, categorical, and assertoric judgments are differentiated is generally pulled out of the air and in part it remains undetermined. The various judgments should be considered as following necessarily from one another and as <i>a further determining of the concept</i>, since the judgment is nothing other than the <i>determinate</i> concept.</div> <div class="remark">In relation to the two previous spheres of <i>being</i> and <i>essence</i>, the <i>determinate concepts</i>, qua judgments, are reproductions of these spheres, but posited in the simple relation of the concept.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The various species of judgment are to be construed not merely as an empirical manifold, but instead as a totality determined by thinking. One of Kant's great services is to have provided some validation for this demand. Kant divided judgments, according to the schema of his table of categories, into judgments of quality, quantity, relation, and modality. Although this division set up by Kant cannot be recognized as adequate (in part because of the merely formal application of the schema of these categories, in part also because of their content), underlying this division, nevertheless, is the genuine intuition that it is the universal forms of the logical idea itself through which the diverse species of judgment are determined. Accordingly, we initially obtain three main species of judgment, which correspond to the stages of being, essence, and concept. The second of these main species is then doubled in turn, corresponding to the character of essence as the stage of difference [<i>Differenz</i>]. The inner ground of this systematic [character] of the judgment is to be sought in the fact that, since the concept is the ideal unity of being and essence, its unfolding, as it comes about in the judgment, also has to reproduce initially these two stages in a transformation [<i>Umbildung</i>] that conforms to the concept, while it itself, the concept, demonstrates itself to be the determining factor for the genuine judgment. – The various species of judgment are to be considered, not as standing next to one another with the same value but instead as forming a sequence of stages, whose differences rest upon the logical meaning of the predicate. This sort of consideration is also already at hand in ordinary consciousness to the extent that one does not hesitate to ascribe a very slight capacity for judgment to those only used to making such judgments like 'this wall is green', 'this stove is hot', and so forth. At the same time, by contrast, it will be said that someone truly understands how to judge only if his judgments concern whether a certain artwork is beautiful, an action is good, and the like. In judgments of the first-mentioned species, the content forms merely an abstract quality and the immediate perception suffices to decide on its presence, whereas, by contrast, if it is said that an artwork is beautiful or that an action is good, the objects named are compared with what they ought to be, i.e. with their concept.</div> <h4 id="HGL195">α. Qualitative judgment</h4> <h6 id="s172">§172</h6> <div>The immediate judgment is the <i>judgment</i> of <i>existence</i> [<i>Urteil des Daseins</i>]: the subject posited in a universality, as its predicate, which is an immediate (thus sensory) quality. (1) <i>Positive judgment</i>: the individual is a particular. But the individual is <i>not</i> a particular; more precisely, such an individual quality does not correspond to the concrete nature of the subject; (2) <i>negative</i> judgment.</div> <div class="remark">It is one of the most essential logical prejudices that such qualitative judgments as 'the rose is red' or 'the rose is not red' can contain truth. They can be <i>correct</i>, i.e. in the limited sphere of perception, finite representing, and thinking. This depends upon the content, which is just as much a finite content, untrue for itself. But the truth rests solely on the form, i.e. the posited concept and the reality corresponding to it; but such truth is not at hand in the qualitative judgment.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. Correctness and truth are very frequently considered to mean the same thing in ordinary life and one accordingly speaks of the truth of some content where it is a matter of mere correctness. Correctness generally affects merely the formal agreement of our representation with its content; however this content may be otherwise constituted. The truth consists, by contrast, in the agreement of the object with itself, i.e. with its concept. It may be correct anyway that someone is sick or that someone has stolen something. But such content is not true since a sick body is not in agreement with the concept of life, and so too theft is an action that does not correspond to the concept of human action. What is to be taken from these examples is that an immediate judgment, in which an abstract quality is asserted of something immediately individual, however correct it might be, still contains no truth since subject and predicate do not stand in the judgment in the connection of reality and concept to one another. – The lack of truth of the immediate judgment consists, further, in the fact that its form and content do not correspond to one another. If we say 'this rose is red', then it lies in the copula '<i>is</i>' that subject and predicate agree with one another. But now the rose, as something concrete, is not merely red; instead it also has an odour, a determinate form, and many other sorts of determinations that are not contained in the predicate 'red'. On the other side, this predicate, as an abstract universal, does not apply merely to this subject. There are also, in addition, other flowers and generally other objects that are likewise red. Subject and predicate in the immediate judgment thus come into contact with one another, as it were, only at <i>one</i> point but they do not cover one another. The state of affairs is quite different in the conceptual judgment. If we say 'this action is good', this is then a conceptual judgment. One notices immediately that here, between subject and predicate, there is not this loose and external connection as there is in the immediate judgment. In the immediate judgment the predicate consists in some abstract quality or other which may or may not apply to the subject. In the conceptual judgment, by contrast, the predicate is, as it were, the soul of the subject, by means of which the subject, as the body of this soul, is determined through and through.</div> <h6 id="s173">§173</h6> <div>In this as <i>first</i> negation there still remains the <i>relation</i> of the subject to the predicate, which is thereby something relatively universal, the <i>determinacy</i> of which has only been negated ('the rose is <i>not</i> red' entails that it still has colour – immediately another [colour] which, however, would only be a positive judgment in turn). The individual, however, is also <i>not</i> a universal. (3) Hence, (aa) the judgment collapses in itself into the empty <i>identical</i> relation: the individual is the individual – <i>identical</i> judgment; and (bb) it collapses into itself as the present, complete inadequacy of the subject and predicate: a so-called <i>infinite</i> judgment.</div> <div class="remark">Examples of the latter are 'the spirit is no elephant', 'a lion is no table', and so forth – sentences that are correct but as nonsensical [<i>widersinnig</i>] as the identical sentences 'a lion is a lion', 'the spirit is spirit'. These sentences are, to be sure, the truth of the immediate, so-called qualitative judgment, but not judgments at all, and they can only surface in a subjective thinking that can fix upon an untrue abstraction. Objectively considered, they express the nature of <i>beings</i> [<i>des Seienden</i>] or <i>sensory</i> things, namely, that they collapse into an <i>empty</i> identity and into a <i>fulfilled</i> relation that is, however, the <i>qualitative otherness of what is related</i>, their complete inadequacy.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The negative-infinite judgment, in which no relation at all between subject and predicate is on hand any more, is usually cited in formal logic merely as a senseless [<i>sinnlose</i>] curiosity. Nevertheless, this infinite judgment is in fact not to be considered merely as a contingent form of subjective thinking. Instead it ensues as the very next dialectical result of the preceding, immediate judgments (of the positive and the simply negative), whose finitude and lack of truth explicitly come to light in it. Crime can be regarded as an objective example of the negative-infinite judgment. Whoever commits a crime, more precisely a theft, does not merely negate, as in the civil juridical dispute, the particular right of someone else to this specific matter. Instead he negates the right of that person altogether and, for this reason, he is not merely ordered to restore the matter which he stole, but is instead punished in addition because he violated the right as such, i.e. the right in general. The civil juridical dispute is, by contrast, an example of the simple-negative judgment since in it merely this particular right is negated and right in general is recognized in the process. The connection here is thus as it is for the negative judgment 'this flower is not red', by means of which merely this particular colour, but not colour altogether, is negated in regard to the flower since it can still be blue, yellow, and so forth. Likewise then, too, death is a negative-infinite judgment in contrast to sickness, which is a simple-negative judgment. In a sickness, merely this or that particular vital function is restricted or negated; by contrast, in death, as one would say, body and soul separate from one another, i.e. subject and predicate fall completely outside one another.</div> <h4 id="HGL196">β. The judgment of reflection</h4> <h6 id="s174">§174</h6> <div>The individual, posited <i>as</i> individual (reflected in itself) in the judgment, has a predicate, opposite which the subject, relating itself to itself, remains at the same time an <i>other</i>. – In the <i>concrete existence</i> [<i>Existenz</i>], the subject is no longer immediately qualitative, but is instead in a <i>connection with</i> and <i>joined to an other</i>, an external world. The <i>universality</i> has acquired hereby the meaning of this relativity. (For example, useful, dangerous; weight, acidity, – then drive, and so forth.) </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The judgment of reflection is distinguished generally from the qualitative judgment by the fact that its predicate is no longer an immediate, abstract quality but instead of the sort that, by means of it, the subject demonstrates itself to be related to the other. If we say, for example, 'this rose is red', we consider the subject in its immediate individuality without relation to another. If, by contrast, we make the judgment 'this plant has healing powers', we consider the subject, the plant, as standing in relation with another (the illness to be healed by it) through its predicate, the healing capacity. Matters are similar with the judgments 'this body is elastic', 'this instrument is useful', 'this punishment works as a deterrent', and so forth. The predicates of such judgments are generally determinations of reflection, by means of which one has moved beyond the immediate individuality of the subject while the concept of it is still not given. – The usual sort of rationalizing [<i>Räsonnement</i>] tends above all to immerse itself in this manner of judgment. The more concrete the object of concern, the more viewpoints it presents for reflection, by means of which, meanwhile, the distinctive nature, i.e. its concept, is not exhausted.</div> <h6 id="s175">§175</h6> <div>(1) The subject, the individual <i>as</i> individual (in the <i>singular</i> judgment), is a universal [<i>ein Allgemeines</i>]. (2) In this relation it is elevated above its singularity. This expansion is an external one, the subjective reflection, at first the indeterminate <i>particularity</i> (in the <i>particular</i> judgment which is, immediately, negative as well as positive; – the individual is in itself divided, it relates itself in part to itself, in part to another). (3) Some are the universal, so the particularity is expanded to universality; or this universality, determined by the individuality of the subject, is the <i>set of all</i> (commonality, the usual universality-of-<i>reflection</i>). </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. Since it is determined in the <i>singular</i> judgment as universality, the subject by this means moves beyond itself, past itself as this mere individual. When we say 'this plant has healing powers', this entails not merely that this individual plant has them but that several or some do and this results in the <i>particular</i> judgment ('Some plants have healing powers', 'Some human beings are inventive', and so forth). Through this particularity, the immediately individual [subject] loses its self-sufficiency and enters into a connection [<i>Zusammenhang</i>] with another. The human being is, as <i>this</i> human being, no longer merely this individual human being; instead he stands alongside other human beings and is thus one in a group [<i>Menge</i>]. Precisely by this means, however, it also belongs to the universal and is thereby elevated. The particular judgment is positive as well as negative. If only some bodies are elastic, then the rest are not elastic. – Herein lies, then, again the progression to the third form of the judgment-of-reflection, i.e. to the judgment of the set of all ('all human beings are mortal', 'all metals are conductors of electricity'). The set of all [<i>Allheit</i>] is that very form of universality towards which reflection at first tends. In this connection the individuals form the foundation and it is our subjective act by means of which the individuals are gathered together and are determined [as belonging together] in their entirety [<i>als Alle bestimmt</i>]. The universal appears here only as an external bond which encompasses the individuals subsisting for themselves and indifferent to it. The universal is, nevertheless, in fact the ground and basis, the root and substance of the individual. If we consider, for example, Caius, Titus, Sempronius, and the other inhabitants of a city or a country, then the fact that they are collectively human beings is not merely something common to them, but their <i>universal</i>, their <i>genus</i>, and all these individuals would not be at all without this, their genus. In contrast to this, matters are different with that superficial, only so-called universality that is in fact something that merely accrues to all individuals and is common to them. It has been noted that human beings, in contrast to animals, have this in common with one another, that they are equipped with ear lobes. It is, meanwhile, apparent that if, somehow, one or the other should not have ear lobes, the rest of his being, his character, his capacities, and so forth would not be affected by this. It would, by contrast, make no sense to assume that Caius could somehow not be a human being but be brave, learned, and so forth. What the individual human being is in particular, this is only insofar as he is, above all, a human being as such and in the universal sense [<i>im Allgemeinen</i>], and this universal is not only something external to and alongside other abstract qualities or mere determinations of reflection. Instead it is much more what pervades everything particular, encompassing it within itself.</div> <h6 id="s176">§176</h6> <div>By the fact that the subject is likewise determined as universal, the identity of it and the predicate is <i>posited</i> as indifferent, as is, thanks to this, the determination of the judgment itself. This unity of the <i>content</i> as the universal identical with the subject's negative reflection-in-itself makes the relation of the judgment a <i>necessary</i> relation. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The progression from the reflexive judgment of the set of all to the necessary judgment can be found already in our ordinary consciousness insofar as we say: 'what accrues to everything, accrues to the genus and is, therefore, necessary.' When we say: '<i>all</i> plants', '<i>all</i> humans', and so forth, this is the same as if we say '<i>the</i> plant', '<i>the</i> human', and so forth.</div> <h4 id="HGL197">γ. Judgment of necessity</h4> <h6 id="s177">§177</h6> <div>The judgment of necessity as the identity of the content in its difference (1) contains within the predicate in part the <i>substance</i> or <i>nature</i> of the <i>subject</i>, the <i>concrete</i> universal – the <i>genus</i>; in part, since this universal equally contains in itself the determinacy as negative, the <i>excluding</i> essential determinacy – the <i>species</i>; – <i>categorical</i> judgment.<br/>
(2) In keeping with their substantiality, the two sides acquire the form of self-sufficient actuality, the identity of which is only an <i>inner</i> identity, and with that the actuality of the one is at the same time <i>not its</i> actuality, but instead the being <i>of the other</i>; – <i>hypothetical</i> judgment.<br/>
(3) At the same time, in this externalization of the concept, the inner identity is <i>posited</i> and so the universal is the genus that is identical with itself in its excluding individuality. The judgment which has this universal on both sides of it, the one time as such, the other time as the sphere of its self-excluding particularization – the <i>either/or</i> of which just as much as the <i>as well as</i> is the genus – is the <i>disjunctive judgment</i>. With this, the universality at first as genus and then also as the scope of its species is determined and posited as a totality. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The categorical judgment ('Gold is a metal', 'The rose is a plant') is the <i>immediate</i> judgment of necessity and corresponds, in the sphere of essence, to the relationship of substantiality. All things are a categorical judgment, i.e. they have their substantial nature, which forms the fixed and unchangeable foundation of them. Only when we regard things from the viewpoint of their genus and as determined by it with necessity, does the judgment begin to be a true one. It must be designated a deficiency in someone's training in logic, if judgments like these: 'Gold is expensive' and 'gold is a metal' are regarded as standing on the same level. That gold is expensive concerns an external relation of it to our inclinations and needs, to the costs of acquiring it, and so on, and the gold remains what it is, even if that external relation alters or falls away. By contrast, being a metal constitutes the substantial nature of gold, without which it or anything else that is otherwise in it or asserted of it cannot subsist. Matters are the same if we say 'Caius is a human being'; in this way we declare that everything that he may otherwise be only has value and meaning insofar as it corresponds to this, his substantial nature, to be a human being. – Furthermore, however, even the categorical judgment remains deficient insofar as in it the factor of particularity does not yet receive its due. Thus, for example, the gold is indeed metal, but silver, copper, iron, and so forth are likewise metals, and being metal as such behaves indifferently to the particular character of its species. Herein lies the progression from the categorical to the <i>hypothetical</i> judgment which can be expressed by the formula: 'if A is, then B is'. We have here the same progression as earlier from the relationship of substantiality to the relationship of causality. In the hypothetical judgment, the determinacy of the content appears as mediated, as dependent upon another, and this is then precisely the relationship of cause and effect. The meaning of the hypothetical judgment is then generally this, that through it the universal is posited in its particularization and, with this, we acquire, as the third form of necessary judgment, the <i>disjunctive</i> judgment. 'A is either B or C or D'; the poetic artwork is either epic or lyrical or dramatic; the colour is either yellow or blue or red, and so on. The two sides of the disjunctive judgment are identical. The genus is the totality of its species and the totality of the species is the genus. This unity of the universal and the particular is the concept and it is this, which now forms the content of the judgment.</div> <h4 id="HGL198">δ. The judgment of the concept</h4> <h6 id="s178">§178</h6> <div>The <i>judgment of the concept</i> has the concept, the totality in simple form, for its content, the universal with its complete determinacy. The subject is (1) initially an individual that has, as its predicate, the <i>reflection</i> of the particular existence on its universal, – the agreement or lack of agreement of these two determinations: good, true, correct, and so forth – <i>assertoric</i> judgment. </div> <div class="remark">In ordinary life, too, one only calls it judging when a judgment is of this sort, e.g. the judgment whether an object, action, and so forth is good or bad, true, beautiful, and so forth. One will not ascribe a power of judgment to someone [simply] for knowing, for example, how to make positive or negative judgments such as 'this rose is red', 'this painting is red, green, dusty', and so forth.</div> <div class="remark">Even in philosophy, through the principle of immediate knowing and believing, the assertoric judgment has been made into the sole and essential form of the doctrine (despite the fact that in society the assertoric judgment counts as improper, when someone claims that it is supposed to be valid by itself). In the so-called philosophical works that maintain that principle, one can read hundreds upon hundreds of <i>assurances</i> about reason, knowing [<i>Wissen</i>], thinking, and so forth, which seek to gain credence for themselves through endless repetitions of one and the same point, since external authority no longer counts for much.</div> <h6 id="s179">§179</h6> <div>In what is at first the immediate subject of the assertoric judgment, this judgment does not contain that relation of the particular and the universal that is expressed in the predicate. This judgment is thus merely a <i>subjective</i> particularity and the opposite assurance stands over against it with the same right or, rather, the same lack of right. It is thus (2) at the same time only a <i>problematic</i> judgment. But (3) [insofar as] the objective particularity is <i>posited</i> in the <i>subject</i>, [i.e.] its particularity as the constitution [<i>Beschaffenheit</i>] of its existence, the subject then expresses the relation of that particularity to its constitution, i.e. to its genus and, with this, expresses what (see preceding section) makes up the content of the predicate (<i>this</i> – the immediate individuality – <i>house</i> – genus –, <i>so and so constituted</i> – particularity –, is good or bad) – <i>apodictic</i> judgment. – <i>All things</i> are a <i>genus</i> (their determination and purpose) in one <i>individual</i> actuality with a <i>particular</i> constitution; and their [i.e. all things'] finitude consists in the fact that their particular [character] may or may not be adequate to the universal.</div> <h6 id="s180">§180</h6> <div>In this way, subject and predicate are each themselves the entire judgment. The immediate constitution of the subject shows itself at first as the <i>mediating ground</i> between the individuality of the actual and its universality, as the ground of the judgment. What has in fact been posited is the unity of the subject and the predicate, as the concept itself; it is the fulfilment of the empty '<i>is</i>', the copula, and since its moments are at the same time differentiated as subject and predicate, it is posited as their unity, as the relation mediating them – <i>the syllogism</i>.</div> <h3 id="HGL199">c. The syllogism</h3> <h6 id="s181">§181</h6> <div>The syllogism is the unity of the concept and the judgment; – it is the concept as the simple identity (into which the judgment's differences of form have gone back), and [it is] judgment insofar as it is posited at the same time in reality, namely, in the difference of its determinations. The syllogism is what is <i>rational</i> and <i>everything</i> rational.</div> <div class="remark">The syllogism tends to be put forward usually as the <i>form of the rational</i>, but as a subjective form and without pointing up any sort of connection between it and any other rational content, e.g. a rational grounding principle, a rational action, idea, and so forth. In general, there is much and frequent talk of <i>reason</i> and appeal is made to it without indicating <i>what</i> it is, what its <i>determinacy</i> is and without giving the slightest thought to what inferring via syllogism [<i>schließen</i>] is. In fact, <i>formally inferring via syllogism</i> is the rational in such a non-rational [<i>vernunftlose</i>] manner, that it has nothing to do with a rational basic content. Since, however, such a content can be rational only through the determinacy through which <i>thinking</i> is reason, it can be rational only through the form which the syllogism is. – This, however, is nothing else than the <i>posited</i>, (at first formally) <i>real concept</i>, as this section expresses. The syllogism is, on account of this, the <i>essential ground of everything true</i>; and <i>the definition of the absolute</i> is from now on that it is the syllogistic inference or, articulated in the form of a sentence, it is this determinacy: '<i>everything is a syllogism</i>'. Everything is a <i>concept</i>, and its existence is the difference of its moments, so that its <i>universal</i> nature provides itself with external reality through <i>particularity</i> and, by this means and as negative reflection-in-itself, makes itself something <i>individual</i>. – Or conversely, the actual is an <i>individual</i> that by means of <i>particularity</i> elevates itself into <i>universality</i> and makes itself identical with itself. – The actual is one, but [it is] similarly the segregation of the moments of the concept, and the syllogism is the cyclical course taken by the mediation of its moments, a course through which it posits itself as one.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. Like the concept and the judgment, the syllogism also tends to be regarded merely as a form of our subjective thinking and, in keeping with this tendency, it is said that the syllogism is the justification [<i>Begründung</i>] of the judgment. Now, to be sure, the judgment points to the syllogism, but it is not merely our subjective doing through which this progression comes about. Instead it is the judgment itself that posits itself as syllogism and, in doing so, returns to the unity of the concept. More precisely, it is the apodictic judgment that forms the transition to the syllogism. In the apodictic judgment we have an individual that relates itself, thanks to its constitution, to its universal, i.e. its concept. The particular appears here as the mediating middle between the individual and the universal and this is the basic form of the syllogism, the further development of which, formally construed, consists in the fact that the individual and the universal also occupy this place, by means of which the transition from subjectivity to objectivity is then formed.</div> <h6 id="s182">§182</h6> <div>The <i>immediate</i> syllogism is such that the determinations of the concept stand opposite one another in an external <i>connection</i> as <i>abstract</i> determinations, so that the two <i>extremes</i> [are] the <i>individuality</i> and <i>universality</i>, but the concept, as the <i>middle</i> joining the two together, is likewise only the abstract <i>particularity</i>. The extremes are accordingly posited as subsisting <i>for themselves</i>, as <i>indifferent</i> to one another as they are to the middle [term that joins them]. This syllogism is thus rational but non-conceptual [<i>begrifflos</i>] – it is the formal <i>syllogism of the understanding</i>. – In it the subject is joined together with <i>another</i> determinacy; or through this mediation the universal subsumes a subject <i>external</i> to it. In a rational syllogism, by contrast, the subject joins <i>itself</i> together <i>with itself</i> by means of this mediation. It is only a subject in this way, or the subject is only in itself the syllogism of reason.</div> <div class="remark">In the following consideration, the syllogism of the understanding is expressed in terms of its ordinary, usual meaning, [namely,] in the subjective manner attributed to it in the sense that <i>we</i> make such syllogistic inferences. In fact it is <i>only</i> a <i>subjective</i> inferring via syllogism, though this has equally the objective meaning that it expresses only the <i>finitude</i> of things, but in the determinate manner that the form has attained here. With respect to finite things, subjectivity as thinghood, separable from its properties, [i.e.] its particularity, is equally separable from its universality insofar as this is the mere quality of the thing and its external connection with other things as its genus and concept.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. In keeping with the construal of the syllogism, mentioned above, as the form of the rational, reason itself has been defined as the capacity to make syllogistic inferences and understanding, by contrast, as the capacity to form concepts. Underlying these definitions is a representation of the spirit as the mere sum of powers or capabilities lying next to one another. Apart from this superficial representation, what is to be noted about this combination of the understanding with the concept and reason with the syllogism is that just as little as the concept is to be regarded merely as a determination of the understanding, so, too, the syllogism is to be regarded without further ado as rational. On the one hand, what is usually treated in formal logic in the doctrine of the syllogism is in fact nothing other than the mere syllogism of the understanding, which in no way deserves the honour of counting as the form of the rational, indeed, as the rational itself. On the other hand, the concept as such is so little merely a form of understanding that it is rather the understanding in the mode of abstracting alone, through which the concept is demoted to this level. In accordance with this, there is also a tendency to distinguish mere concepts of the understanding [<i>Verstandesbegriffe</i>] and concepts of reason [<i>Vernunftbegriffe</i>], which is nevertheless not to be understood as though there <i>were</i> two distinct species of concepts but instead much more so that it is <i>our</i> doing either to stand pat merely with the negative and abstract form of the concept or to construe it, in keeping with its true nature, as at the same time positive and concrete. Thus, for example, the concept of freedom, insofar as it is a mere concept of the understanding, is freedom considered as the abstract opposite of necessity, while the true and rational concept of freedom contains in itself necessity as sublated. Similarly, the definition of God put forward by so-called deism, is the concept of God insofar as it is a mere concept of the understanding, while by contrast the Christian religion, knowing [<i>wissen</i>] God as the triune God, contains the rational concept of God.</div> <h4 id="HGL1910">α. Qualitative syllogism</h4> <h6 id="s183">§183</h6> <div>The first syllogism is <i>the syllogism</i> of <i>existence</i> [<i>Schluss des Daseins</i>] or the <i>qualitative syllogism</i>, as it was portrayed in the previous section, (1) I – P – U [individuality, particularity, universality], that a subject as individual is <i>joined together</i>, through <i>a quality</i>, with some <i>universal determinacy</i>.</div> <div class="remark">That the subject (<i>terminus minor</i>) has even further determinations than that of individuality, similarly that the other extreme (the predicate of the conclusion, the <i>terminus maior</i>) is further determined than being merely a universal, does not come into consideration here; only the forms through which they constitute the <i>syllogism</i> [come into consideration].</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The <i>syllogism</i> of existence is a syllogistic inference merely at the level of understanding and, indeed, insofar as the individuality, the particularity, and the universality stand opposite one another in an entirely abstract manner here. Thus, this <i>syllogism</i> is then the most extreme way that the concept comes to be outside itself. We have here something immediately individual as a subject; some particular side, a property, in this subject is then emphasized and by means of this property the individual demonstrates itself to be a universal. So, for example, we say 'this rose is red; red is a colour, therefore, this rose is something coloured'. It is this form [<i>Gestalt</i>] of the <i>syllogism</i>, above all, that is typically discussed in ordinary logic. In former times, the <i>syllogism</i> was considered the absolute rule of all knowing and a scientific claim obtained then as something justified only if it was demonstrated in a manner mediated by a <i>syllogism</i>. Today one encounters the diverse forms of the <i>syllogism</i> almost exclusively only in compendia of logic, and acquaintance with those various forms counts as empty pedantry, of no further use of any sort either in practical life or even in science. In this regard, it deserves to be noted, first, that although it would be superfluous and pedantic to enter on the scene at each occasion with the entire elaboration of formal modes of inferring, the diverse forms of inference nonetheless continue to impose themselves on our knowing. For example, if someone waking up in the morning during the wintertime hears carriages clanging on the street and this occasions him to consider that things may well have frozen solid, he performs an operation of inferring and we repeat this operation daily amidst the most manifold complications. Becoming explicitly conscious of this, one's daily actions as a thinking being might thus at least be of no slighter interest than the well-recognized interest in becoming acquainted, not only with the functions of our organic life, e.g. the functions of digestion, production of the blood, breathing, and so forth, but also with the functions of the processes and formations of nature surrounding us. It will undoubtedly have to be conceded in this connection that just as little as a foregoing study of anatomy and physiology is needed in order to digest properly, to breath properly, and so on, one needs to have studied logic first in order to draw proper conclusions. – It is Aristotle who first observed and described the diverse forms and so-called figures of the syllogism in their subjective meaning and, indeed, did so with such sureness and determinacy that essentially nothing further had to be added. Although this accomplishment brings Aristotle great honour, by no means is it the forms of syllogistic inference at the level of understanding or at the level generally of finite thinking that he employed in his genuine philosophical investigations (see the note to § 189).</div> <h6 id="s184">§184</h6> <div>This syllogism is (α) completely <i>contingent</i> with respect to its determinations since the middle, as an abstract particularity, is <i>merely any sort of determinacy</i> of the subject, of which, as something <i>immediate</i> and thus empirically concrete, it has several. Hence, it can be joined together just as much with <i>many sorts of other</i> universalities, just as an <i>individual</i> particularity in turn can also have several diverse determinacies in itself. Thus, the subject can be related to <i>different</i> universals by means of <i>the same medius terminus</i> [middle term].</div> <div class="remark">It is more that formally inferring has gone out of fashion than that its incorrectness has been detected and that the lack of its use has been justified on that basis [i.e. its incorrectness]. This and the following section indicate the vacuousness [<i>Nichtigkeit</i>] of such inferring for the truth.</div> <div class="remark">By means of such syllogisms (according to the side indicated in the section), the most diverse sorts of things can be <i>proved</i>, as it is said. The only thing required is to take up the <i>medius terminus</i> from which the transition to the desired determination can be made. Yet, with a different <i>medius terminus</i>, something else, even something opposite, may be <i>proven</i>. – The more concrete an object is, the more sides it has that inhere in it and can serve as <i>medii termini</i>. Which of these sides is more essential than the other must depend again on the sort of inferring that fixes upon the individual determinacy and can likewise easily find for it a side and a <i>respect</i> in terms of which it can be rendered <i>important</i> and <i>necessarily valid</i>.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. As little as in the daily course of life one tends even to think of inference at the level of understanding, it nonetheless plays its role incessantly there. Thus, for example, in the civil dispute of law, it is the business of the advocates to make the most favourable claim to a right [<i>Rechtstitel</i>] for their parties. In a logical respect, however, such a claim to a right is nothing other than a <i>medius terminus</i>. The same also takes place in diplomatic negotiations if, for example, diverse powers lay claim to one and the same land. In this connection, the right of inheritance, the geographical location of the land, the descendancy and language of its inhabitants, or any sort of other ground can be taken up as <i>medius terminus</i>.</div> <h6 id="s185">§185</h6> <div>(β) This syllogism is equally contingent on account of the form of the <i>relation</i> in it. According to the concept of the syllogism, the true is the relation of differentiated entities [<i>Unterschiedenen</i>], through a middle that is their unity. The relations of the extremes to the middle (the so-called <i>premises</i>, the major [<i>Obersatz</i>] and the minor [<i>Untersatz</i>]) are, however, <i>immediate</i> relations. </div> <div class="remark">This contradiction of the syllogism expresses itself again through an infinite <i>progression</i> [<i>Progreß</i>] as the demand that each of the premises likewise be proven by means of a syllogism; since this syllogism, however, has two immediate premises of the same sort, this demand then repeats itself and, indeed, as a demand constantly doubling itself, ad infinitum.</div> <h6 id="s186">§186</h6> <div>What here (on account of the empirical importance) has been noted as a <i>deficiency</i> of the syllogism, to which in this form absolute correctness is ascribed, must of itself sublate itself [<i>sich…von selbst aufheben</i>] in the further determination of the syllogism. Here, within the sphere of the concept as well as in the judgment, the <i>opposite</i> determinacy is not merely <i>in itself</i> on hand, but instead it is <i>posited</i>, and hence, for the further determination of the syllogism, it is only necessary to take up what is posited each time by it itself.<br/>
By means of the immediate inference (I – P – U), the <i>individual</i> is mediated with the universal and posited as <i>universal</i> in this <i>conclusion</i> [<i>Schlußsatz</i>]. By this means, the individual as subject, thus itself as universal, is now the unity of the two extremes and the mediating factor, which results in the <i>second figure</i> of the syllogism ((2) U – I – P). This expresses the truth of the first figure, [namely] that the mediation took place in the individuality and accordingly is something contingent.</div> <h6 id="s187">§187</h6> <div>The second figure joins the universal with the particular (i.e. the universal that emerges from the previous conclusion is determined by the individuality, and accordingly occupies the position of the immediate subject). As a result, the <i>universal</i> is posited as particular, via the conclusion [of the second figure], thus as the factor mediating the extremes, the positions of which are now taken by the others in the <i>third figure</i> of the syllogism ((3) P – U – I).</div> <div class="remark">The so-called <i>figures</i> of the syllogism (Aristotle rightly acknowledges only <i>three</i> of them; the <i>fourth</i> is a superficial, indeed fatuous, addition of the moderns) are placed next to one another in the standard treatment of them, without the slightest thought being given to showing their necessity, even less their meaning and their value. For this reason it is no wonder, if the figures have later been treated as an empty formalism. They have, however, a very basic [methodical] sense that rests upon the necessity that <i>each moment</i> as a determination of the concept becomes itself the <i>whole</i> and the <i>mediating ground</i>. – What determinations the sentences otherwise have, whether they may be universal and so forth or negative, in order to bring about a <i>correct</i> inference, this is a <i>mechanical</i> investigation that has rightly come to be forgotten on account of its concept-less mechanism and its lack of inner meaning. – One can appeal least of all to Aristotle for the importance of such an investigation and of syllogism at the level of understanding. To be sure, he described these like countless other forms of the spirit and nature, and he both investigated and presented their determinacy. But in his metaphysical <i>concepts</i> as well as in the <i>concepts</i> of the natural and the spiritual, he was far from intending to make the form of the syllogism at the level of the understanding a foundation and criterion, so far that probably not a single one of these concepts would have been able to arise or be left standing if it were supposed to be subjected to the laws of understanding. In the considerable amount of descriptive and sensible [<i>verständigen</i>] detail that Aristotle, after his fashion, brings together, the <i>speculative</i> concept is invariably what dominates for him and he does not allow that inferring at the level of mere understanding, the inferring that he first outlined in so determinate a fashion, to enter into this sphere.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The objective sense of the figures of the syllogism is in general this, that everything rational demonstrates itself in the form of a threefold syllogism and, to be sure, in such a way that each of its members occupies equally the position of an extreme and that of the mediating middle. This is expressly the case with the three members of philosophical science, i.e. the logical idea, nature, and spirit. First, nature here is the middle member that joins the others together. Nature, this immediate totality, unfolds into the two extremes of the logical idea and spirit. The spirit, however, is spirit only by being mediated by nature. Second, then, the spirit, which we know [<i>wissen</i>] as individual and active, is the middle, and nature and the logical idea are the extremes. It is the spirit that recognizes in nature the logical idea and elevates it to its essence. Third, the logical idea is similarly the middle; it is the absolute substance of the spirit as of nature, the universal, what pervades everything. These are the members of the absolute syllogism.</div> <h6 id="s188">§188</h6> <div>Since each moment has run through the position of the middle and the extremes, their determinate <i>difference</i> relative to one another has <i>sublated</i> itself and, in this form where there is no difference between its moments, the syllogism first has the external identity of the understanding, the <i>equality</i> [<i>Gleichheit</i>], as its relation – the <i>quantitative</i> or <i>mathematical</i> syllogism. If two things are equal to a third, then they are equal to one another. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The quantitative syllogism mentioned here surfaces familiarly in mathematics as an axiom. It is customarily said of it, as of the other axioms, that its content cannot be proven, but also that this proof is not needed since it is immediately evident. Nevertheless, these mathematical axioms are in fact nothing other than logical sentences that are to be derived, insofar as particular and determinate thoughts can be articulated in them, from universal and self-determining thinking, a derivation which has to be considered then as their proof. This is the case here with the quantitative syllogism, set up in mathematics as an axiom that demonstrates itself to be the next result of the qualitative or immediate syllogism. – The quantitative syllogism, moreover, is the completely formless inference since in it the difference between the members, a difference determined by the concept, is sublated. Which sentences here are supposed to be premises depends upon external circumstances and, for this reason, in the application of this syllogism one presupposes what already stands fast and is proven elsewhere.</div> <h6 id="s189">§189</h6> <div>By this means, it has come about with respect to the <i>form</i> (1) that each moment received the determination and position of the <i>middle</i>, hence the whole in general, and with this it has lost the one-sidedness of its abstraction (§ 182 and § 184) <i>in itself</i>; (2) that <i>the mediation</i> (§ 185) has been completed, also only <i>in itself</i>, namely, only as a <i>circle</i> of mediations that mutually presuppose one another. In the first figure (I – P – U), the two premises, I – P and P – U, are still unmediated; the former being mediated in the third, the latter in the second figure. But each of these two figures equally presupposes the two other figures to mediate their premises.<br/>
In keeping with this, the mediating unity of the concept is no longer to be posited only as an abstract particularity, but instead as the <i>developed</i> unity of individuality and universality and, indeed, at first as the <i>reflected</i> unity of these determinations, the <i>individuality</i> determined <i>at the same time</i> as universality. This sort of middle yields the <i>syllogism of reflection</i>.</div> <h4 id="HGL1911">β. Syllogism of reflection</h4> <h6 id="s190">§190</h6> <div>The middle is in the first place (1) not alone the abstract, <i>particular</i> determinacy of the subject, but instead at the same time as <i>all individual concrete</i> subjects, to which that determinacy as only one among others accrues. As such, the middle yields the syllogism of <i>the set of all</i> [<i>Schluß der Allheit</i>]. The major premise (the subject of which is the particular determinacy, the <i>terminus medius</i>, as the set of all) <i>pre</i>supposes the <i>conclusion</i>, of which it is supposed to be the presupposition. It thus rests upon (2) <i>induction</i>, the middle of which is the <i>complete</i> [<i>vollständig</i>] set of the individuals as such, <i>a, b, c, d</i>, and so forth. Since, however, the immediate empirical individuality is different from the universality and, for that reason, cannot ensure any completeness, the induction rests upon (3) <i>analogy</i>, the middle of which is an individual but in the sense of its essential universality, its genus or essential determinacy. – The first syllogism refers, for its mediation, to the second and the second to the third; but the latter equally demands a universality or the individuality as genus after the forms of the external relation of individuality and universality have been run through in the figures of the syllogism of reflection.<br/>
By means of the syllogism of the set of all, some improvement is made relative to the deficiency of the basic form of the inference at the level of the understanding (pointed out in § 184). But the improvement is only such that a new deficiency arises, namely, that the major premise presupposes as an accordingly <i>immediate</i> sentence what was supposed to be the conclusion. – 'All human beings are mortal, <i>therefore</i> Gajus is mortal', 'all metals are electric conductors, <i>therefore</i>, for example, copper is, too'. In order to be able to assert those major premises that are supposed to express the <i>set of all</i> of the <i>immediate</i> individuals and to be essentially <i>empirical</i> sentences, it is required that already <i>previously</i> the sentences about the individual Gajus, the <i>individual</i> copper are confirmed for themselves as correct. – Everyone rightly notices not merely the pedantry, but the vapid [<i>nichtssagende</i>] formalism of such syllogisms as 'all humans are mortal, but now Gajus is human, and so forth'. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The syllogism with respect to the set of all refers to the syllogism of induction in which the individuals form the middle that joins together the extremes. If we say 'all metals are electric conductors', this is an empirical sentence that results from testing undertaken with all individual metals. By this means, we get the inference of induction, which has the following form:<br/>
P – I – U<br/>
I<br/>
I<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
.<br/>
Gold is metal, silver is metal; similarly, copper, lead, and so forth. This is the major premise. Then comes the minor premise 'all these bodies are electric conductors', and from this results the conclusion that all metals are electric conductors. Hence, here the individuality in the sense of the set of all is the binding factor. This syllogism then likewise sends us on to another syllogism in turn. It has, as its middle, the complete set of individuals. This presupposes that the observation and experience be completed in a certain domain. But because it is a matter of individualities here, this yields in turn the progression [<i>Progreß</i>] into infinity (I, I, I…). In an induction the individuals can never be exhausted. If one says 'all metals', 'all plants', and so forth, this only means as much as 'all metals, all plants with which one is familiar up to now'. Each induction is, therefore, imperfect. One has, indeed, made this and that observation, one has made many observations, but not all cases, not all individuals have been observed. It is this deficiency of induction that leads to <i>analogy</i>. From the fact that things of a certain genus have a certain property, it is inferred in the syllogism of analogy that other things of the same genus have the same property. Thus, for example, it is a syllogism of analogy if it is said: this law of motion has been found previously to hold for all planets; hence, a newly discovered planet will probably move according to the same law. In empirical sciences, analogy is rightly held in high regard and very important results have been attained on this path. It is the instinct of reason that has the presentiment that this or that empirically uncovered determination is grounded in the inner nature or the genus of an object and which is further based on this. Incidentally, analogy can be more superficial or more rigorous [<i>gründlich</i>]. Suppose, for example, it is said: 'Gaius, a human being, is a learned individual; Titus is also a human being; hence, he is also likely to be learned.' This is in any case a very bad analogy and, indeed, for this reason, that for a human being to be learned is not grounded without further ado in this, his genus. Nonetheless, the same sort of superficial analogies occur very frequently. Thus, for example, it is customarily said: 'the Earth is a heavenly body and has inhabitants; the Moon is also a heavenly body; hence, it is probably also inhabited'. This analogy is not a bit better than the previously mentioned one. That the Earth has inhabitants does not rest merely on the fact that it is a heavenly body; in addition, further conditions are also required, such as, first and foremost, the fact that it is surrounded by an atmosphere, that there is water on hand (something connected to that atmosphere), and so forth – conditions that, as far as we know, are lacking in the case of the Moon. What is called 'philosophy of nature' in the modern era consists to a great extent in a vapid play with empty, external analogies, which are nonetheless supposed to count as profound results. On account of this, philosophical consideration of nature has fallen into a deserved disrepute [<i>Mißkredit</i>].</div> <h4 id="HGL1912">γ. Syllogism of necessity</h4> <h6 id="s191">§191</h6> <div>As far as the merely abstract determinations of this syllogism are concerned, it has the <i>universal</i> as the middle term, just as the syllogism of reflection has the <i>individuality</i> as the middle term – the latter in terms of the second figure, the former in terms of the third (§ 187); the universal posited as essentially determined in itself. (1) At first, the <i>particular</i> in the sense of the determinate <i>genus</i> or <i>species</i> is the mediating determination – in the <i>categorical</i> syllogism; (2) the <i>individual</i> in the sense of immediate being that is both mediated and mediating – in the <i>hypothetical</i> syllogism; (3) the mediating <i>universal</i> is also posited as the totality of its <i>particularizations</i> and as an <i>individual</i> particular, an exclusive individuality – in the <i>disjunctive</i> syllogism; – so that one and the same universal is in these determinations as merely in forms of difference.</div> <h6 id="s192">§192</h6> <div>The syllogism has been taken in terms of the differences contained in it and the universal result of the course [<i>Verlauf</i>] of those differences is that these differences and the concept's manner of being-outside-itself sublate themselves [<i>das Sichaufheben</i>] in it. Indeed, (1) each of the moments themselves has demonstrated itself to be the <i>totality</i> of the moments and, hence, to be the entire syllogism; thus, they are <i>in themselves</i> identical. (2) The <i>negation</i> of their differences and their mediation constitutes the manner of <i>being-for-itself</i>, such that it is one and the same universal that is in these forms and is accordingly also posited as their identity. In this ideality of the moments, inferring acquires the determination of essentially containing the <i>negation</i> of the determinacies by means of which it runs its course and, with this, the determination of being a mediation by way of sublating the mediation and a manner of joining the subject together, not with <i>another</i>, but with the <i>sublated</i> other, <i>with itself</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. In ordinary logic, the first part, forming the so-called 'doctrine of elements', tends to come to a close with the treatment of the doctrine of the syllogism. Following upon this is the so-called 'doctrine of method', as the second part, in which it is supposed to be demonstrated how an entire body of scientific knowledge is to be brought about, through application of the forms of thinking, treated in the doctrine of elements, to the objects<sup><a href="part0021.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ10877" id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ13628">27</a></sup> at hand. Logic at the level of the understanding provides no further information about where these objects come from and what sort of a connection it has in general with the thought of objectivity. Thinking counts here as a merely subjective and formal activity, while what is objective, in contrast to thinking, counts as something firm and on hand for itself. This dualism, however, is not the true state of things [<i>das Wahre</i>] and it is a thoughtless procedure to take up the determinations of subjectivity and objectivity without further ado and to refrain from inquiring into their origin. Both, subjectivity as well as objectivity, are in any case thoughts and, to be sure, determinate thoughts which have to demonstrate themselves in universal and self-determining thinking. This has happened here first with respect to subjectivity. We have come to recognize this, or the subjective concept, which contains in itself the concept as such, the judgment, and the syllogism as the dialectical result of the first two major stages of the logical idea, namely, the stages of being and of essence. If it is said of the concept, 'it is subjective and only subjective', then this is completely correct insofar as it is, to be sure, subjectivity itself. But then, in addition, no less subjective than the concept as such are the judgment and the syllogism, determinations that in ordinary logic, next to the so-called 'laws of thought' (the principles of identity, difference, and sufficient reason), form the content of the so-called 'doctrine of elements'. Furthermore, this subjectivity with the determinations of it mentioned here (the concept, the judgment, and the syllogism) is not to be considered an empty framework which first has to acquire its filling from without, through objects on hand for themselves. Instead it is the subjectivity itself that, as dialectical, breaks through its limitation and by means of the syllogism discloses itself to be objectivity.</div> <h6 id="s193">§193</h6> <div>This <i>realization</i> of the concept, in which the universal is this <i>singular</i> totality that has returned into itself and whose differences are equally this totality, which has determined itself to be an <i>immediate</i> unity by sublating mediation, – this realization of the concept is the <i>object</i> [<i>das Objekt</i>]. </div> <div class="remark">At first glance, this transition from the subject, from the concept in general, and, more precisely, from the syllogism into the object, may seem strange, especially if one regards the syllogism only at the level of the understanding and regards inferring only as an act of consciousness. At the same time, it cannot be our task to want to make this transition plausible to representation. It is only possible to recall whether our customary representation of what is called an 'object' corresponds roughly to what constitutes the determination of the object here. By 'object', however, one tends to understand not merely an abstract entity or concretely existing thing or something in general actual, but instead something concretely and <i>completely</i> self-sufficient in itself; this completeness is the <i>totality of the concept</i>. That the <i>object</i> is also something standing opposite [<i>Gegenstand</i>] and <i>external</i> to another, this will be determined subsequently insofar as it posits itself in <i>opposition</i> to the <i>subjective</i>. Here, as that into which the concept has passed over from its mediation, it is at first only an <i>immediate</i>, neutral [<i>unbefangenes</i>] object, just as the concept is determined to be the <i>subjective</i> only in the subsequent opposition.</div> <div class="remark">Furthermore, the <i>object</i> in general is also the <i>one</i> whole, in itself as yet indeterminate, the objective world in general, God, the absolute object. But the object equally has difference within it, breaking down in itself into an indeterminate manifold (as objective <i>world</i>) and each of these <i>individuated entities</i> is also an object, an existence [<i>Dasein</i>], in itself concrete, complete, self-sufficient.</div> <div class="remark">As objectivity has been compared with being, concrete existence [<i>Existenz</i>], and actuality, so too the transition to concrete existence and actuality (since being is the first, completely abstract immediacy) is to be compared with the transition to objectivity. The <i>ground</i> from which concrete existence emerges, the <i>relationship</i> of reflection that sublates [and elevates] itself to actuality [<i>sich zur Wirklichkeit aufhebt</i>], these are nothing other than the <i>concept, posited</i> in a still imperfect way. Or they are only abstract sides of it, the ground being the <i>unity</i> of it merely in the form of essence [<i>wesenhafte</i>], the relationship merely the relation of sides that are supposed to be <i>real, reflected only in themselves</i>. The concept is the unity of both and the object is not only the unity befitting an essence but the unity in itself universal, containing not only real differences but these differences as totalities in itself.</div> <div class="remark">It is clear, moreover, that in all these transitions, it is a matter of more than merely showing the inseparability of the concept or thinking from being. It has been frequently noted that <i>being</i> is nothing more than the simple relation to itself and that this impoverished determination is contained, without further ado, in the concept or even in thinking. The point of these transitions is not to take up determinations only insofar as they are <i>contained</i> [in the concept] (as happens even in the ontological argument for the existence of God based upon the principle that being is <i>one</i> of the realities). The point is instead to take the concept as it is prima facie <i>supposed</i> to be determined for itself as concept, with which this distant abstraction of being or even objectivity still has nothing to do, and to see whether, in its determinacy solely as the determinacy of the <i>concept</i>, it passes over into a form which differs from the determinacy inherent in the concept and appears <i>within it</i>.</div> <div class="remark">If the product of this transition, the object, is placed in relation to the concept that has disappeared in the transition in its peculiar form, then the result can be <i>correctly</i> expressed in such a way that <i>in itself</i> concept, or also, if one prefers, subjectivity, and the object are <i>the same</i>. However, it is equally <i>correct</i> that they are <i>diverse</i>. Since one is as correct as the other, then by the same token one is as incorrect as the other. Such a manner of expression is incapable of presenting their true relationship. The expression <i>in itself</i> here is an <i>abstractum</i> and even more one-sided than the concept itself, the one-sidedness of which in general sublates itself [<i>sich aufhebt</i>] in that it elevates itself [<i>sich aufhebt</i>] to the object, the opposite one-sidedness. Thus, that <i>in itself</i> must also determine itself to <i>being-for-itself</i> through the <i>negation</i> of itself. As is everywhere the case, the speculative identity is not that trivial identity that concept and object are in themselves identical – an observation that has been repeated often enough, but could not be repeated enough, if the aim is to put an end to the shallow and completely malicious misunderstanding of this identity. Understandably, however, this is not something that can be hoped for.</div> <div class="remark">Moreover, if that unity is taken quite generally, without recalling the one-sided form of its <i>being-in-itself</i>, then it is, as is familiar to many, what is <i>presupposed</i> in the <i>ontological proof</i> of God's existence and, indeed, presupposed as <i>what is most perfect</i>. The utterly remarkable thought of this proof first occurs to <i>Anselm</i> who, to be sure, begins by discussing merely whether a content is only in <i>our thinking</i>. These, in brief, are his words: 'Certe id, quo maius cogitari nequit, non potest esse in intellectu solo. Si enim vel in solo intellectu est, potest cogitari <i>esse et in re</i>: quod maius est. Si ergo id, quo maius cogitari non potest, est in solo intellectu; id ipsum, quo maius cogitari non potest, est, quo maius cogitari potest. Sed certe hoc esse non potest.' [Certainly that, of which nothing greater can be thought, cannot be in the intellect alone. For if it is in the intellect alone, it can be thought <i>to be in some thing as well</i>: which is greater. If, therefore, that of which a greater cannot be thought is in the intellect alone, then it is possible to think something greater than that of which nothing greater can be thought. But this certainly cannot be the case.] – In terms of the determinations we are standing among here, <i>finite</i> things are such that their objectivity is not in agreement with the thought of them, i.e. their universal determination, their genus, and their purpose. Descartes and Spinoza, among others, have articulated this unity more objectively, whereas the principle of immediate certainty or belief takes them more in the subjective manner of Anselm, namely, that the determination of God's being is inseparably bound up with the representation of God in <i>our consciousness</i>. If the principle of this belief also takes up [<i>befaßt</i>] the representations of external, finite things into the inseparability of the consciousness of them and their being, because <i>in the intuition</i> they are bound up with the determination of concrete existence, then this is indeed correct. But it would be the greatest thoughtlessness if that were supposed to mean that in our consciousness concrete existence is bound up in the same way with the representation of finite things as with the representation of God. It would be forgotten that finite things are mutable and transient, i.e. that concrete existence is only bound up with them in a transitory manner, that this bond is not eternal, but separable. For this reason, in the course of relegating the sort of connection [<i>Verknüpfung</i>] that obtains in the case of finite things, Anselm rightly declared that alone to be the perfect being that is not merely in a subjective but at the same time in an objective manner. None of the condescension shown towards the so-called 'ontological' proof and against this Anselmian determination of the perfect is of any help, since it lies in every innocent, common sense just as much as it returns in every philosophy, even against one's will and better judgment, as in the principle of immediate belief.</div> <div class="remark">But the deficiency in Anselm's argument (a deficiency, moreover, that Descartes and Spinoza as well as the principle of immediate knowing share with it) is that this <i>unity</i>, articulated as the most perfect being or subjectively as true knowing [<i>Wissen</i>], is <i>presupposed</i>, i.e. it is only assumed as something that is <i>in itself</i>. The <i>diversity</i> of the two determinations is immediately opposed to this identity which is accordingly abstract (something that has long since been held against Anselm). That is, in fact, to say that the representation and concrete existence of the <i>finite</i> are opposed to the infinite since, as noted earlier, the finite is the sort of objectivity that is at the same time not adequate to the purpose, to its essence and concept, the sort of objectivity that differs from it – or that it is the sort of the representation, the sort of subjective entity that does not involve concrete existence. This objection and contrast is sublated only by demonstrating that the finite is something untrue, that these determinations are, <i>for themselves</i>, one-sided and vacuous and that the identity, accordingly, is one into which they themselves pass over and in which they are reconciled.</div> </body>
