<body> <h2 id="HGL151">B. Second position of thought towards objectivity</h2> <div id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ9277">I. Empiricism</div> <h6 id="s37">§37</h6> <div>What first led to <i>empiricism</i> was both the need for a <i>concrete</i> content, in contrast to the abstract theories of the understanding that is incapable of progressing from its generalities to particularization and determination on its own, and the need for a <i>firm foothold</i> against the possibility of <i>being able to prove everything</i> on the plane of, and by the method of, finite determinations. Instead of looking for the true within thought itself, empiricism sets out to fetch it from <i>experience</i>, the inwardly and outwardly present. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. Empiricism owes its origin to the need, referred to in the preceding section, for a <i>concrete content</i> and a <i>firm foothold</i>, a need that the metaphysics of the abstract understanding is incapable of satisfying. Insofar as the concreteness of the content is concerned, the point is simply that the objects of consciousness are known [<i>gewußt</i>] as determinate objects in and of themselves and as unities of diverse determinations. Now as we have seen, this is by no means the case for the metaphysics of the understanding, in keeping with the principle of the understanding. Thinking that merely conforms to the understanding is limited to the form of the abstract universal and lacks the capacity to proceed to the particularization of this universal. Thus, for instance, the old metaphysics undertook to find out through thinking what might be the essence or the basic determination of the soul, and it was then said that the soul is <i>simple</i>. The simplicity thus attributed to the soul has the meaning of an abstract simplicity that excludes difference. The latter was regarded as compositeness, i.e. as the basic determination of the body and, furthermore, of matter in general. Abstract simplicity is, however, a rather poor determination, through which the wealth of the soul and that of spirit cannot be comprehended at all. Because abstract metaphysical thought thus proved to be deficient, the need was felt to take refuge in empirical psychology. The same is true of rational physics. When, for instance, it was said that space is infinite, that nature makes no leaps, etc., then this is quite unsatisfactory in relation to the fullness and life of nature.</div> <h6 id="s38">§38</h6> <div>Metaphysics authenticates its definitions, both its presuppositions and its more determinate content, by appealing to the testimony of representations, i.e. the content that derives initially from experience. <i>Empiricism</i> shares this source, on the one hand, with metaphysics. On the other hand, a single perception is different from experience, and empiricism raises the content belonging to perception, feeling, and intuition to the <i>form of universal representations, sentences</i>, and <i>laws</i>, etc. This happens, however, only in the sense that these universal determinations (e.g. force) are to possess no other meaning and validity for themselves than that taken from perception, and that no connection is supposed to be legitimate unless it has been exhibited in the appearances. As far as the <i>subjective</i> side is concerned, empirical knowing possesses its firm foothold in the fact that in perception consciousness finds its <i>own immediate presence</i> and <i>certainty</i>.</div> <div class="remark">There lies in empiricism this great principle that what is true must exist in actuality and be there for perception. This principle is opposed to the <i>ought</i>, with which reflection inflates itself and looks down on actuality and the present in the name of a <i>beyond</i>, which is supposed to have its seat and existence in subjective understanding alone. Like empiricism, philosophy, too (§ 7), knows only what <i>is</i>; it does not know [<i>weiß</i>] what only <i>ought</i> to be and thus <i>is not there. –</i> As far as the subjective side is concerned, the important principle of <i>freedom</i>, which is part of empiricism, must be recognized as well. This principle means that what a human being is supposed to let stand in his knowing [<i>Wissen</i>], he has to see <i>himself</i>, knowing [<i>wissen</i>] <i>himself</i> to be <i>present</i> in the process. However, insofar as empiricism, carried out consistently, limits its content to the finite, it refuses to acknowledge the supersensible in general, or at least the knowledge and determinacy of the latter, and allows thinking only abstraction and formal universality and identity. – The fundamental delusion in scientific empiricism is always that it uses the metaphysical categories of matter, force (not to mention those of the one, the many, universality, and infinity, etc.), and proceeds to makes <i>inferences</i> guided by such categories, all the while presupposing and applying the forms of syllogistic inference, ignorant that in so doing it itself contains and pursues metaphysics and that it uses those categories and their relationships in a completely uncritical and unconscious fashion.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. From empiricism went forth the call: 'Stop rambling around in empty abstractions, look at your hands, grasp human beings and nature <i>here</i>, enjoy the now!' And it cannot be denied that this call contains an essentially legitimate point. The empty other-worldly reality [<i>Jenseits</i>], the cobweb and nebulous shapes of the abstract understanding, were to be exchanged for the <i>here</i> and now, for this world [<i>Diesseits</i>]. In this way then, the firm foothold, namely the infinite determinability missing in the old metaphysics, was achieved. The understanding picks out only finite determinations; these are inherently [<i>an sich</i>] unsupported and wobbly, and the building erected upon them collapses. To find an infinite determination had been the drive of reason generally; however, the time had not yet come to look for it in thinking itself. As a result, this drive took up the here and now, the this, which possesses the infinite form in itself, if not in its true concrete existence. What is external [<i>das Äußerliche</i>] is <i>in itself</i> the true, for the true is actual and must exist concretely [<i>muss existieren</i>]. Thus, the infinite determinateness that reason seeks is in the world, albeit in sensory, individual form [<i>Gestalt</i>], not in its truth. – More specifically, <i>perception</i> is the form in which matters are supposed to be comprehended [<i>begriffen</i>], and this is the deficiency of empiricism. Perception as such is always of something individual and transitory; knowing, however, does not end with this but in the perceived individual seeks the universal, that which abides, and this is the progression from mere perception to experience. – In order to have experiences, empiricism principally utilizes the form of <i>analysis</i>. In perception, one possesses something concrete in multiple ways whose determinations one is supposed to take apart like peeling away the layers of an onion. This process of splitting them up [<i>Zergliederung</i>] is therefore intended to dissolve the determinations that have grown together, breaking them up [<i>zerlegen</i>] without adding anything but the subjective activity of breaking them up. Analysis is, however, the progression from the immediacy of perception to thought, insofar as the determinations, which the object analysed contains amalgamated within itself, receive the form of universality by being separated. Because empiricism analyses objects, it is in error if it believes that it leaves them as they are, since it in fact transforms the concrete into something abstract. By this process, it happens at the same time that life is taken from the living, for only the concrete, or one, is alive. Nonetheless, this severing [<i>Scheidung</i>] must occur in order to comprehend, and spirit is itself the severing in itself. This, however, is only <i>one</i> side, and the chief point consists in the unification of what has been severed. Insofar as analysis remains committed to the standpoint of separation, the word of the poet applies to it: </div> <div class="remark"><i>Encheiresin naturae</i>, says Chemistry now,</div> <div class="remark">Mocking itself without knowing how.</div> <div class="remark">Then they have the parts and they've lost the whole,</div> <div class="remark">For the link that's missing was the living soul.<sup><a href="part0016.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ12423" id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ15228">13</a></sup><br/>
Analysis takes its point of departure from what is concrete, and with this kind of material it has an enormous advantage over the abstract thinking of the old metaphysics. It establishes the differences, and this is of great importance. These differences, however, are in turn merely abstract determinations, that is, <i>thoughts</i>. Now, insofar as these thoughts count as what things are in themselves, we are back with the presupposition of the old metaphysics, namely that the truth of things is to be found in thought.<br/>
Let us now compare further the standpoint of empiricism with that of the old metaphysics with regard to content. As we saw earlier, the latter had those universal objects of reason such as God, the soul, and the world in general for its content. This content had been taken up from representation, and the business of philosophy consisted in guiding it back into the form of thoughts. Similarly with scholastic philosophy; for it, the dogmas of the Christian Church constituted the presupposed content, and the task consisted in further determination and systematization of that content by means of thought. – The presupposed content of empiricism is of an entirely different sort. It is the sensory content of nature and of finite spirit. Here, then, one sees oneself faced with finite material, and in the old metaphysics with infinite material. This infinite content was then made finite by the finite form of the understanding. In empiricism, we have the same finitude of the form, and the content is finite as well. The method, meanwhile, is the same for both modes of philosophizing, insofar as both start from presuppositions that are regarded as something fixed. For empiricism in general, the external is the true, and even when the existence of something supersensible is admitted, knowledge of it is not supposed to be able to occur. Instead, one is supposed to cling exclusively to what belongs to perception. In the execution of this principle, it has yielded what was later designated <i>materialism</i>. For this kind of materialism, matter as such counts as the truly objective. However, matter itself is already an abstraction [<i>Abstraktum</i>], something that cannot be perceived as such. One can, therefore, say that there is no matter, since however it exists concretely it is always something determinate, concrete. Nevertheless, the abstraction called matter is supposed to be the foundation of everything sensory, i.e. the sensory as such, the absolute individuation in itself, and thus what are outside one another [<i>das Außereinanderseiende</i>]. Now, insofar as this sensory component is and remains a given for empiricism, it is a doctrine of unfreedom, for freedom consists precisely in my having no absolutely other over against me, but depending instead only on a content that I am myself. Furthermore, for this standpoint reason and unreason are merely subjective; that is to say, we have to accept the given as it is, and we have no right to ask whether and in what respect it is rational in and of itself.</div> <h6 id="s39">§39</h6> <div>In reflection on this principle, it was immediately and correctly observed that in what is called <i>experience</i> (which is to be distinguished from mere individual perceptions of individual facts), there are <i>two elements</i>: the infinitely <i>manifold material</i>, [each aspect of which is] individuated for itself, and the <i>form</i>, the determinations of <i>universality</i> and <i>necessity</i>. Empirical observation does indeed show many, indeed countless, perceptions that are alike. Still, <i>universality</i> is something entirely different from a large amount [or set: <i>Menge</i>]. Similarly, empirical observation indeed affords us perceptions of changes <i>following upon one another</i>, or of objects <i>lying side-by-side</i>, but no connection involving necessity. Now insofar as perception is to remain the foundation of what is to count as the truth, universality and necessity appear to be something <i>unwarranted</i>, a subjective coincidence, a mere habit, and its content might just as well be as it is or otherwise. </div> <div class="remark">An important consequence of this is that in this empirical manner the legal and ethical determinations and laws as well as the content of religion appear as something contingent [<i>Zufälliges</i>] and their objectivity and inner truth are given up.</div> <div class="remark">Incidentally, <i>Humean</i> scepticism, from which the preceding reflection chiefly proceeds, must be clearly distinguished from Greek scepticism. Humean scepticism makes the <i>truth</i> of the empirical, of feeling and intuition its foundation, and from there contests the universal determinations and laws on the grounds that they lack justification through sensory perception. Ancient scepticism was so far removed from making feeling or intuition the principle of truth that to the contrary it turned first and foremost against the sensory. (On modern scepticism as compared to the ancient, see Schelling's and Hegel's <i>Kritisches Journal der Philosophie</i>, 1802, vol. I, no. 2.)</div> <div id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ13493">II. Critical philosophy</div> <h6 id="s40">§40</h6> <div>Critical philosophy shares with empiricism the supposition that experience is the <i>sole</i> basis of knowledge, except that it lets that knowledge count, not for truths, but only for knowledge of appearances.<br/>
The initial point of departure is the difference between the elements that result from the analysis of experience: the <i>sensory material</i> and its <i>universal relations</i>. Insofar as this is combined with the reflection cited in the preceding section (that only the <i>individual</i> and only <i>what occurs</i> is contained in perception), the <i>fact is insisted upon</i> at the same time that <i>universality</i> and <i>necessity</i> are to be found in what is called experience as equally essential determinations. Now, since this element does not issue from the empirical as such, it belongs to the spontaneity of <i>thinking</i> or is a priori. – The thought-determinations or <i>concepts of the understanding</i> constitute the <i>objectivity</i> of experiential knowledge. They generally contain <i>relationships</i>, hence they are instrumental in the formation of <i>synthetic</i> judgments a priori (i.e. original relationships between opposed elements). </div> <div class="remark">The fact that the determinations of universality and necessity are found in knowing, is not disputed by Humean scepticism. It is also nothing but a presupposed fact in the Kantian philosophy. In the usual language of the sciences one can say that it has merely put forward a different <i>explanation</i> of that fact.</div> <h6 id="s41">§41</h6> <div>First, the <i>Critical</i> philosophy subjects to scrutiny the value of the <i>concepts of the understanding</i> as they are employed in metaphysics (and, incidentally, in the other sciences and in ordinary representation as well). This critique, however, does not address the <i>content</i> and the specific relationship that these thought-determinations have vis-à-vis each other. Instead, it examines them with a view to the opposition of <i>subjectivity</i> and <i>objectivity</i> in general. This opposition, as it is taken here, refers (see the preceding section) to the difference between the elements <i>internal to</i> experience. <i>Objectivity</i> here means the element of <i>universality</i> and <i>necessity</i>, i.e. the element of the thought-determinations themselves – the so-called <i>a priori</i>. But the Critical philosophy expands the opposition in such a way that experience <i>in its entirety</i>, i.e. both those elements together, belongs to <i>subjectivity</i> and nothing remains opposite it but the <i>thing-in-itself</i>.<br/>
The specific <i>forms of the a priori</i>, i.e. of thinking, taken as merely subjective activity despite its objectivity, result as follows – a systematization that, by the way, rests on merely psychological-historical foundations.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 1</i>. No doubt a very important step was taken by subjecting the determinations of the old metaphysics to scrutiny. Naïve thinking moved innocently among those determinations, which produced themselves straightaway and of their own accord. No thought was given to the question to what extent these determinations have value and validity for themselves. It has already been remarked earlier that free thinking is one that has no presuppositions. The thinking of the old metaphysics was not free, because it allowed its determinations to count without further ado as something pre-existing, as an a priori which reflection did not itself examine. By contrast, the Critical philosophy made it its task to investigate to what extent the forms of thinking were capable of being of assistance in knowing the truth at all. More specifically, the faculty of knowledge was now supposed to be investigated prior to knowing. In this there is contained the correct thought that the forms of thought themselves must indeed be made the object of knowing. However, the misunderstanding of wanting already to know prior to knowing or of wanting not to set foot in the water before one has learned to swim, very quickly creeps into the process. To be sure, the forms of thought should not be employed unexamined, but examining them is already itself a process of knowing. Consequently, the activity of the forms of thought and their critique must be joined in knowing. The forms of thought must be considered in and of themselves [<i>an und für sich</i>]. They are themselves the object as well as the activity of the object. They themselves examine themselves and they must determine for themselves their limits and point up their deficiency in themselves. This is the activity of thinking that will soon be specifically considered under the name of <i>dialectic</i>, about which a preliminary remark must here suffice, namely that it is to be regarded not as something brought to bear on thought-determinations from outside of them, but instead as immanent in them.<br/>
The primary concern of the Kantian philosophy is thus that thinking is supposed to investigate itself, the extent to which it is capable of knowing. Nowadays, the Kantian philosophy has been left behind, and everybody wants to be at a point further on. To be further along, however, has a double meaning: both to be further ahead and to be further behind. Looked at in clear light, many of our philosophical endeavours are nothing but the method of the old metaphysics, an uncritical thinking along in a way everyone is capable of.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 2</i>. Kant's examination of the thought-determinations suffers essentially from the defect that they are not being considered in and for themselves but only from the viewpoint of whether they are <i>subjective</i> or <i>objective</i>. What is understood by <i>objectivity</i> is, following the linguistic usage of ordinary life, what is on hand outside of us and reaches us from the outside by means of perception. Now Kant denied that thought-determinations (such as cause and effect) possess objectivity in the sense mentioned here, i.e. that they are given in perception, and instead regarded them as belonging to our thinking itself or to the spontaneity of thinking, and as subjective in <i>this</i> sense. This notwithstanding, Kant calls what is thought, and more specifically the universal and the necessary, the objective, and what is only sensed the subjective. The linguistic usage referred to just now thus seems to have been stood on its head, and Kant has for this reason been accused of linguistic confusion. But this is a great injustice. Looked at more closely, things are as follows. To the ordinary consciousness, what stands opposite it, what is perceivable by way of the senses – such as this animal, that star, etc. – seems to exist for itself, to be something independent. By contrast, thoughts count as something lacking independence and as being dependent on something else. In fact, however, what is perceivable by way of the senses is what is genuinely dependent and secondary, and thoughts are by contrast what is truly independent and primary. It was in this sense that Kant called what belongs to thought (i.e. the universal and the necessary) the <i>objective</i> element, and in this he was entirely right. On the other hand, what is perceivable by way of the senses is indeed <i>subjective</i> insofar as it does not have its support within itself and is as fleeting and transitory as thought is enduring and inwardly stable. Indeed, nowadays we find that the determination of the distinction mentioned here and advocated by Kant, namely, between the objective and the subjective, is part of the linguistic usage of the more educated consciousness. Thus, for instance, one demands that the judgment about a work of art be objective and not subjective, and by this is meant that the judgment should not proceed from contingent individual sentiments and emotions of the moment, but instead should take into consideration the universal points of view as they are grounded in the essence of art. By the same token, one may distinguish between taking an objective and a subjective interest in some scientific activity.<br/>
To continue, however, even the Kantian objectivity of thinking itself is in turn only subjective insofar as thoughts, despite being universal and necessary determinations, are, according to Kant, <i>merely our</i> thoughts and distinguished from what the thing is <i>in itself</i> by an insurmountable gulf. By contrast, the true objectivity of thinking consists in this: that thoughts are not merely our thoughts but at the same time the <i>in itself</i> of things and of the object-world [<i>des Gegenständlichen</i>] in general. – <i>Objective</i> and <i>subjective</i> are comfortable expressions that are employed effortlessly, but whose use nonetheless easily generates confusion. According to the discussion so far, objectivity has a threefold meaning. <i>In the first place</i>, it has the meaning of what is on hand externally, as distinct from what is <i>purely</i> subjective, i.e. what is meant or dreamed up. <i>Second</i>, it has the meaning established by Kant, i.e. the universal and the necessary, in contrast to what, as inherent to sensation, is contingent, particular, and subjective. And <i>third</i>, it has the meaning last mentioned above, of what is thought to be in itself, what is there, in contrast to what is merely thought by us and therefore still different from the matter itself or in itself.</div> <h6 id="s42">§42</h6> <div>(a) <i>The theoretical faculty</i>, knowledge as such. – This philosophy identifies the <i>original identity of</i> the <i>I</i> in thinking (i.e. the transcendental unity of self-consciousness) as the specific <i>ground</i> of the concepts of the understanding. The representations that are given by means of feeling and intuition constitute a <i>manifold</i> in terms of their <i>content</i>, but equally by virtue of their form, i.e. by virtue of the status of being outside one another as is characteristic of sensoriness, with its two forms of space and time, which as forms (the universal) of intuition, are themselves a priori. The I relates the manifold of sensing and intuiting to itself [the I] and unifies it [the manifold] within itself [the I] as <i>one</i> consciousness (pure apperception) and, as a result, this manifold is brought to an identity, into an original combination. The determinate ways of relating in the aforesaid manner are the pure concepts of the understanding, the <i>categories</i>.</div> <div class="remark">It is well known that the Kantian philosophy made it very easy for itself in <i>locating</i> the categories. The <i>I</i>, the unity of self-consciousness, is quite abstract and entirely indeterminate. How is one then to arrive at the <i>determinations</i> of the I, the categories? Fortunately, the <i>various forms of judgment</i> are already listed empirically in ordinary logic. Now to judge is to <i>think</i> a determinate object. The various forms of judgment that had already been enumerated thus provide the various <i>determinations of thought. –</i> It remains the <i>Fichtean</i> philosophy's profound contribution [<i>tiefe Verdienst</i>] to have reminded us that the <i>thought-determinations</i> must be exhibited in their <i>necessity</i> and that it is essential that they be <i>derived. –</i> This philosophy should at least have had the effect on the method of doing logic that the thought-determinations in general or the usual logical subject matter, the <i>kinds</i> of concepts, judgments, and syllogisms, would no longer simply be taken up from observation and thus gathered up merely empirically, but that they be derived from thinking itself. If thinking is to be capable of proving anything, if logic must demand that <i>proofs</i> be given, and if it wants to teach how to give proofs, then it should be capable above all of proving the content most proper to it and seeing its necessity.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 1</i>. It is Kant's contention, then, that the thought determinations have their source in the I, and that therefore the I provides the determinations of universality and necessity. – When we look at what is now lying before us, it is a manifold in general. The categories are then simple forms [<i>Einfachheiten</i>] to which this manifold refers. By contrast, the sensory dimension [<i>das Sinnliche</i>] comprises what are outside one another, asunder, external to themselves; this is its proper fundamental determination. Thus, for example, the 'now' has being only in relation to a before and an after. Likewise, red is present only insofar as it stands in contrast to a yellow and a blue. This other, however, is exterior to the item sensed, and the latter exists only insofar as it is not the other, and only insofar as the other exists. The exact reverse of the sensory dimensions (items existing outside one another and external to themselves) holds for thinking or the I. The latter is what is originally identical, one with itself and existing simply with itself [<i>schlechthin bei sich Seiende</i>]. When I say 'I', this represents the abstract relation to oneself, and whatever is placed in this unity is being infected by it and transformed into it. Thus, the I is, so to speak, the melting pot and the fire by which the indifferent manifoldness is consumed and reduced to unity. This, then, is what Kant calls <i>pure apperception</i> to distinguish it from ordinary apperception, which takes up the manifold as such into itself, whereas pure apperception, in contrast to this, is to be regarded as the activity of making things mine. – With this, the nature of all consciousness has, to be sure, been correctly articulated. Human beings' striving is directed generally at knowing the world, appropriating and submitting it to their will, and towards this end the reality of the world must, so to speak, be crushed, that is, idealized. At the same time, however, it needs to be noted that it is not the subjective activity of self-consciousness that introduces absolute unity into the manifoldness. This identity is, rather, the absolute, the true itself. It is, so to speak, the benevolence of the absolute to release the individualities to their self-enjoyment, and this absolute drives them back into the absolute unity.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 2</i>. Expressions such as <i>transcendental unity of self-consciousness</i> look very difficult, as if something monstrous were hiding behind them, but the matter is really simpler than that. What Kant understands by <i>transcendental</i> is the result of how it differs from the <i>transcendent</i>. For the <i>transcendent</i> is in general what surpasses the determinateness of the understanding. In this sense, it first arises in mathematics. Thus, in geometry it is said that one must imagine the circumference of a circle as consisting of infinitely many infinitely small straight lines. So here determinations that for the understanding are completely different from one another (such as the straight and the curved) are explicitly posited as being identical. Now the self-consciousness that is identical with and infinite in itself (as distinct from the ordinary consciousness determined by finite material) is also such a transcendent entity. Kant, meanwhile, designates that unity of self-consciousness merely as <i>transcendental</i>, and by this he means that it is only subjective and does not also belong to objects as they are in themselves.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 3</i>. That the <i>categories</i> should be regarded only as belonging to <i>us</i>, i.e. as subjective, must seem rather bizarre to the natural consciousness, and there is indeed something skewed about it. This much is, however, correct, namely that the categories are not contained in the immediate sensation. Consider, for instance, a piece of sugar. It is hard, white, sweet, and so on. But now we say that all these properties are united in <i>one</i> object, and this <i>unity</i> does not exist in the sensation. Things are the same when we regard two events as standing in a relationship of cause and effect to one another. What is perceived here are the two individual events that follow after one another in time. The fact, however, that one is the cause and the other the effect (the causal nexus between the two) is not perceived but instead is present only for our thinking. Now although the categories (such as, for example, unity, cause, and effect, and so forth) do belong to thinking as such, it does not follow at all from this that they should for that reason be <i>ours</i> alone, and not also determinations of the objects themselves. This, however, is supposed to be the case according to Kant's outlook. His philosophy is a <i>subjective idealism</i>, insofar as the <i>I</i> (the cognitive subject) supplies the <i>form</i> as well as the <i>matter</i> of knowing, the one qua <i>thinking</i>, the other qua <i>sensing. –</i> We in fact do not need to care much about the content of this subjective idealism. To be sure, one might somehow suppose that reality has been withdrawn from the objects by virtue of the fact that their unity is transferred to the subject. Meanwhile, neither the objects nor we gain anything from the fact that <i>being</i> accrues to them. Everything depends on the content, namely, whether <i>it</i> is something <i>true</i>. That things merely <i>are</i> does not by itself help them. Time takes care of <i>what is</i>, and soon it will likewise not be. – One could also say that according to subjective idealism human beings can imagine that a lot rests on <i>them</i>. And yet, if his world is a mass of sensory intuitions, he has no reason to be proud of such a world. Nothing at all, therefore, depends on that difference between subjectivity and objectivity. Instead, it is the content on which everything depends, and this is equally subjective and objective. A crime is also objective in the sense of a mere concrete existence [<i>Existenz</i>], but it constitutes a concrete existence that is null and void in itself, a fact also that then comes to exist [<i>zum Dasein kommt</i>] as such in punishment.</div> <h6 id="s43">§43</h6> <div>On the one hand, it is through the categories that mere perception is elevated to the level of objectivity, to the level of <i>experience</i>; but, on the other hand, these concepts, taken as unities of subjective consciousness only, are conditioned by the given material. With respect to themselves [<i>für sich</i>], the categories are empty, having application and use only in experience, the other element of which, the determinations of feeling and intuition, are likewise something merely subjective. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. To assert of the categories that, with respect to themselves, they are empty is unjustified insofar as they possess in any case content through the fact that they are <i>determinate</i>. To be sure, the content of the categories is indeed not perceivable through the senses, it is not spatio-temporal. And yet, this is to be regarded as an advantage rather than a defect of them. Recognition of this fact is also found even in ordinary consciousness and, indeed, in <i>such</i> a way that one says more about a book, say, or a speech being rich in content to the extent that more thoughts, general results, and so on, are to be found in it. Just as, conversely, one does not let a book or, more specifically, a novel count as being rich in content simply because it heaps up a great amount of individual occurrences, situations, and the like. Ordinary consciousness thus explicitly recognizes that <i>more</i> belongs to the <i>content</i> than the sensory material, and this <i>more</i> consists in the thoughts and here primarily in the <i>categories</i>. – In this connection, it should also be noted that the assertion concerning the emptiness of the categories with respect to themselves has indeed a correct meaning, insofar as we must not stop short at them and their totality (i.e. the logical Idea), but must progress to the real domains of nature and spirit. This progression, however, must not be construed as though content alien to the logical idea were to come to it from the outside, but instead that it is the logical idea's own activity of further determining and unfolding itself as nature and spirit.</div> <h6 id="s44">§44</h6> <div>The categories are therefore incapable of being determinations of the absolute, something that is not given in a perception, and, for that reason, the understanding or knowledge by means of the categories is unable to know <i>things in themselves</i>. </div> <div class="remark">The <i>thing-in-itself</i> (and under <i>thing</i>, spirit, God are also included) expresses the object insofar as one <i>abstracts</i> from everything that it is for consciousness, i.e. from all determinations of sensation [<i>Gefühlsbestimmungen</i>] as well as from all determinate thoughts of it. It is easy to see what remains, namely the <i>complete abstractum</i>, something entirely <i>empty</i>, determined only as a <i>beyond</i>; the <i>negative</i> of representation, feeling, determinate thinking, and so on. Equally simple, however, is the reflection that this <i>caput mortuum</i> is itself merely <i>the product</i> of thought, more specifically, [the product] of thought that has progressed to pure abstraction, [the product] of the empty I that makes this empty <i>identity</i> of itself into an <i>object</i> for itself. The <i>negative</i> determination that this abstract identity receives as <i>object</i> is similarly listed among the Kantian categories and is something just as familiar as that empty identity. – One can only wonder, then, why one sees it repeated so often that one does not know [<i>wissen</i>] what the <i>thing-in-itself</i> is, when there is nothing easier to know than this.</div> <h6 id="s45">§45</h6> <div>Now it is <i>reason</i>, the faculty of the <i>unconditioned</i>, that grasps the conditioned character of these acquaintances with things, gathered from experience [<i>Erfahrungskenntnisse</i>]. What is here called object of reason, namely the <i>unconditioned</i> or the <i>infinite</i>, is nothing but the self-same, or it is the above-mentioned (§ 42) <i>original identity</i> of the <i>I</i> in <i>thinking. Reason</i> means this <i>abstract I</i>, or the thinking that makes this pure identity into an object or purpose for itself [i.e. for the thinking]. See the Remark in the preceding section. The acquaintances with things, gathered from experience, do not measure up to this identity utterly <i>devoid of determinateness</i>, since they are in any case findings of a <i>determinate</i> content. Insofar as such an unconditioned object is taken to be the absolute and the true object of reason (as the <i>idea</i>), acquaintances with things gathered from experience are as a result declared to be the untrue, to be <i>appearances</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. It is first with Kant that the difference between the understanding and reason has been emphasized in a definite way and set down in such manner that the former has the finite and the conditioned as an object and the latter the infinite and the unconditioned. It must be acknowledged as a very important result of the Kantian philosophy that it established the finitude of the merely experience-based knowledge of the understanding and designated its content as <i>appearance</i>. Still, we should not stop short at this negative result and reduce the unconditioned nature of reason to the merely abstract identity with itself that excludes difference. Insofar as reason is regarded in this way merely as stepping out beyond the finite and conditioned character of the understanding, by this means it is in fact itself downgraded to something finite and conditioned, for the true infinite is not merely on the far side of the finite, but instead contains the finite as sublated within it. The same holds equally for the <i>idea</i>, which Kant, it is true, rehabilitated, insofar as he vindicated it for reason by distinguishing it from the abstract determinations of the understanding, not to mention mere sensory representations – things that in ordinary life would also be called an idea. And yet, with respect to it [the idea] he stopped short at the negative and what merely <i>ought to be. –</i> Furthermore, construing the objects of our immediate consciousness (i.e. those forming the content of experiential knowledge) as mere <i>appearances</i> must in any case be regarded as a very important result of the Kantian philosophy. For ordinary consciousness (i.e. the sensory consciousness of the understanding), the objects it knows [<i>weiß</i>] count in their individuatedness as independent and self-grounded, and insofar as they prove to be related to one another and conditioned by one another, this mutual dependence on each other is regarded as something external to the objects that does not belong to their essential nature. Against this, it must be maintained, of course, that the objects that we know [<i>wissen</i>] directly are mere appearances, which is to say that they do not have the ground of their being in themselves but in an other. However, everything depends then on how this other is determined. According to the Kantian philosophy, the things we know [<i>wissen</i>] are only appearances for <i>us</i>, and what they are <i>in themselves</i> remains for us an inaccessible world beyond this one [<i>Jenseits</i>]. The untutored consciousness has rightly objected to such a subjective idealism for which what forms the content of our consciousness is something belonging <i>merely</i> to ourselves, something only posited by <i>us</i>. The fact of the matter is indeed this, that the things we immediately know [<i>wissen</i>] are mere appearances not only <i>for us</i>, but <i>in themselves</i>, and that it is the proper determination of finite things to have the ground of their being not in themselves but in the universal divine <i>idea</i>. This interpretation of things is also to be designated as idealism, albeit as <i>absolute idealism</i> in contrast to the subjective idealism of the Critical philosophy. This absolute idealism, although it does go beyond ordinary realist consciousness, is to be regarded as anything but an exclusive possession of philosophy. To the contrary, it forms the foundation of all religious consciousness, insofar as the latter, too, regards the sum total of everything that is, in general the world as it exists, as created and governed by God.</div> <h6 id="s46">§46</h6> <div>The need arises, however, of knowing [<i>erkennen</i>] this identity or the empty <i>thing-in-itself</i>. Now <i>to know</i> means nothing other than knowing [<i>wissen</i>] an object in terms of its <i>determinate</i> content. A determinate content, however, contains multiple <i>connections</i> within itself and grounds connections with many other objects. For such a determination of the above infinite or <i>thing-in-itself</i> this kind of reason would have nothing but the <i>categories</i> at its disposal. Insofar as it wants to use them for this purpose, it <i>soars over</i> [<i>überfliegend</i>] objects (it becomes transcendent). </div> <div class="remark">At this point, the second aspect of the <i>critique of reason</i> enters the scene, and this second aspect is as such more important than the first. The first is the view dealt with above, that the <i>categories</i> have their source in the unity of self-consciousness and that, as a result, knowledge by means of them does indeed contain nothing objective, and that the objectivity ascribed to them (cf. §§ 40, 41) is itself only something <i>subjective</i>. If this is the issue at stake, then the Kantian critique is merely a <i>subjective</i> (banal) <i>idealism</i> that does not engage the content, focuses only on the abstract forms of subjectivity and, indeed, remains ensconced one-sidedly in the former, i.e. subjectivity, as the final, absolutely affirmative determination. When it comes to considering the so-called <i>application</i> that reason makes of the categories for knowledge of its objects, then the content of the categories is being discussed, at least for some determinations, or at any rate this would be an occasion at which it might be discussed. It is of particular interest to see how <i>Kant</i> assesses this <i>application of the categories to the unconditioned</i>, i.e. metaphysics. This procedure shall be briefly presented and critiqued here.</div> <h6 id="s47">§47</h6> <div>1. The <i>first unconditioned</i> that is considered is the <i>soul</i> (see above, § 34). – In my consciousness I find myself always (α) as the <i>determining subject</i>, (β) as <i>singular</i> or abstractly simple, (γ) as <i>one and the same, identical</i> in all the manifoldness of what I am conscious of, (δ) as something distinguishing <i>myself</i> as thinking from all <i>things outside me</i>.<br/>
Now the procedure of the former metaphysics is correctly described as substituting for these <i>empirical</i> determinations <i>thought-determinations</i>, i.e. the corresponding <i>categories</i>. In this way the following four statements result: (α) the <i>soul is a substance</i>, (β) it is <i>a simple substance</i>, (γ) it is <i>numerically identical</i> at different times of its existence, (δ) it stands in a <i>relationship</i> to the <i>spatial dimension</i> [<i>zum Räumlichen</i>].<br/>
In this substitution, a deficiency is noted, namely that two different determinations are exchanged for one another (<i>paralogism</i>), namely, empirical determinations for categories, so that it would be illegitimate <i>to infer</i> the latter from the former, or generally to replace the former with the latter.<br/>
As can be seen, this critique expresses nothing but the <i>Humean</i> observation mentioned above in § 39 that the thought-determinations in general, namely universality and necessity, are not to be found in perception and that the empirical is different, in terms of content as in terms of its form, from the thought-determination.</div> <div class="remark">If the empirical were to constitute the authentication of thought, then the latter would indeed have to be precisely demonstrated in perception. – Substantiality, simplicity, identity with itself and an independence that maintains itself while being in community with the material world cannot be asserted of the soul. The Kantian critique of metaphysical psychology attributes this exclusively to the fact that the determinations that consciousness lets us <i>experience</i> of the soul are not exactly the same as those that <i>thinking</i> produces in this connection. According to the presentation above, however, even Kant has <i>knowing</i>, indeed even <i>experiencing</i>, consist in the fact that <i>perceptions</i> are thought; that is to say, the determinations belonging at first to perception are <i>transformed</i> into determinations of thought. – In any case, it should be deemed a good result of the Kantian critique that philosophizing about spirit has been freed from the soul-<i>thing</i>, from the categories and thus from the questions concerning the <i>simplicity</i> or <i>compositeness</i>, the <i>materiality</i>, and so forth, of the soul. – However, the true viewpoint regarding the <i>illegitimacy</i> of such forms, even for ordinary human understanding, will surely not be that they are <i>thoughts</i>, but that such thoughts in and of themselves hold no truth. – If thought and appearance do not correspond to each other completely, one initially has the choice of regarding the one or the other as deficient. In Kantian idealism, insofar as it concerns what belongs to reason, the deficiency is blamed on the thoughts, such that they are held to be insufficient, because they do not adequately correspond to what is perceived and to a consciousness that restricts itself to the scope of perception, a consciousness in which the thoughts are not to be found. The content of thought in and of itself goes unmentioned here.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. Generally speaking, paralogisms are faulty syllogisms whose mistake consists precisely in using one and the same word in a different sense in both premises. According to Kant, the procedure of the old metaphysics in rational psychology is based on such paralogisms, insofar as merely empirical determinations of the soul are here regarded as belonging to it in and of itself. – It is quite correct, moreover, that predicates such as <i>simplicity</i>, <i>immutability</i>, and so on, are not to be attributed to the soul, yet not for the reason given by Kant, namely that reason would then overstep the limit set for it, but because abstract determinations of the understanding such as these are too poor for the soul and because it is something quite different from what is simple, immutable, and so on. Thus, for instance, the soul is indeed simple identity with itself, but qua active it is at the same time distinguishing itself from itself within itself. By contrast, the <i>merely</i>, i.e. the abstractly simple, precisely as such, is at the same time something dead. – The fact that Kant, through his polemic against the old metaphysics, removed those predicates from the soul and from spirit is to be regarded as a great result. However, he completely misses <i>why</i> it is.</div> <h6 id="s48">§48</h6> <div>2. In reason's attempt to know the <i>second</i> unconditioned object (§ 35), the <i>world</i>, it falls into <i>antinomies</i>, i.e. the affirmation of two <i>opposite</i> sentences about the <i>same</i> object and, indeed, in such a way that each of these sentences must be affirmed with equal necessity. From this it follows that the worldly content, whose determinations incur such a contradiction, cannot be something <i>in itself</i>, but only appearance. The <i>resolution</i> is that the contradiction does not apply to the object in and of itself, but pertains solely to reason engaged in trying to know [<i>allein der erkennenden Vernunft zukommt</i>].</div> <div class="remark">This is where it is brought up that it is the content itself, namely the categories themselves, that bring about the contradiction. This thought that the contradiction posited in the realm of reason [<i>am Vernünftigen</i>] by the determinations of the understanding is <i>essential</i> and <i>necessary</i> must be regarded as one of the most important and profound advances in the philosophy of recent times. The resolution is as trivial as the view is profound. It consists merely in a tenderness for worldly things. It is not supposed to be the worldly essence that bears the blemish of contradiction, but it is supposed to fall to thinking reason <i>alone</i>, the <i>essence of spirit</i>. Now probably nobody is going to object to the claim that the world <i>as it appears</i> displays contradictions to the spirit beholding it – for the world as it appears is the world for the subjective spirit, i.e. for <i>sensoriness</i> and <i>understanding</i>. But now if the worldly <i>essence</i> is compared with the spiritual <i>essence</i>, one can marvel at the naïveté with which the humble claim has been put forth and repeated that it is not the worldly essence, but instead the thinking essence, i.e. reason, that is in itself contradictory. To use the expression that reason incurs contradiction <i>only</i> because of <i>the application of the categories</i> is of no help. For it is claimed in the process that this application is <i>necessary</i> and that reason possesses no other determinations for knowing than the categories. Knowing is indeed <i>determining</i> and <i>determinate</i> thinking. If reason is merely empty, indeterminate thinking, it thinks <i>nothing</i>. If reason is ultimately reduced to that <i>empty identity</i> (see the following section), then it is in the end happily freed from the above contradiction by the easy sacrifice of all content and import [<i>Inhalt und Gehalt</i>].</div> <div class="remark">It can further be noted that the neglect of a deeper consideration of the antinomies initially led to Kant listing only <i>four</i> antinomies. He arrived at these four, because as with the so-called paralogisms he presupposed the table of categories and in so doing followed the manner that has since become so popular, namely to place the determination of an object under an otherwise ready-made <i>schema</i>, instead of deriving them from the concept. Further <i>desiderata</i> concerning the execution of the antinomies I have on occasion pointed out in my <i>Science of Logic</i>. – The main thing to be noted is that the antinomy occurs not only in the four specific objects taken from cosmology but instead in <i>all</i> objects of all genera, in <i>all</i> representations, concepts, and ideas. To know [<i>wissen</i>] this and to gain knowledge of objects thus characterized belongs to the essence of a philosophical consideration. This characteristic constitutes what determines itself further on as the <i>dialectical</i> moment of the logical.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. From the standpoint of the old metaphysics it was assumed that, if knowing falls into contradictions, this would be only an accidental aberration and rest on a subjective mistake in making inferences and in formal reasoning [<i>räsonnieren</i>]. According to Kant, however, it is inherent in the nature of thinking itself to lapse into contradictions (antinomies) when it wants to gain knowledge of the infinite. Now, as mentioned in the Remark to the above section, pointing out the antinomies is to be regarded as a very important advancement of philosophical knowing insofar as, by this means, the rigid dogmatism of the metaphysics of the understanding was done away with and the dialectical movement of thought was indicated. Nonetheless, at the same time, despite this advancement, note must be taken of the fact that here, too, Kant stopped short at the merely negative result of the unknowability of the in-itself of things and did not press on to the true and positive significance of the antinomies. The true and positive significance of the antinomies consists in general in this: that everything actual contains within itself opposite determinations, and that therefore knowing and, more specifically, comprehending [<i>Begreifen</i>] an object means nothing more or less than becoming conscious of it as a unity of opposite determinations. Now while, as pointed out earlier, in the consideration of objects the metaphysical knowledge of which was at issue, the old metaphysics went to work by applying abstract determinations of the understanding to the exclusion of their opposites, Kant sought, by contrast, to show how, for claims generated in this way, contrasting claims with an opposite content are to be posited with equal justification and equal necessity opposite them. In pointing out these antinomies, Kant restricted himself to the cosmology of the old metaphysics, and in his polemic against it he managed to produce four antinomies by presupposing the schema of the categories. The <i>first</i> concerns the question of whether the world is to be considered limited or not according to space and time. The <i>second</i> deals with the dilemma of whether matter is to be considered divisible ad infinitum or consisting of atoms. The <i>third</i> antinomy refers to the opposition between freedom and necessity, in the sense, namely, that the question is posed whether everything in the world must be considered to be conditioned by the causal nexus or whether free beings, i.e. absolute starting-points of action in the world, are to be assumed as well. To this is added finally, as the <i>fourth</i> antinomy, the dilemma of whether the world in general has a cause or not. – The method that Kant follows in his discussion of these antinomies is as follows. He juxtaposes the opposite determinations contained in them as thesis and antithesis and tries to prove both of them, i.e. to exhibit both of them as the necessary results of thinking them through. In the process he explicitly defends himself against the charge that he sought smoke and mirrors in order to perform a spurious lawyer's proof. However, the proofs that Kant proposes for his theses and antitheses must indeed be regarded as mere pseudo-proofs, since what is supposed to be proved is always already contained in the presuppositions that form the starting-point and only through the long-winded, apagogic process is the semblance of mediation produced. Nonetheless, the construction of these antinomies will always remain a very important and praiseworthy result of the Critical philosophy, insofar as the actual unity of those determinations that are kept apart by the understanding is thereby articulated, even if at first only in a subjective and immediate way. Thus, for example, the first of the aforementioned cosmological antinomies contains the notion that space and time are to be regarded not only as continuous but also as discrete, whereas in the old metaphysics one stopped short at mere continuity and, in keeping with this, the world was considered unlimited in terms of space and time. It is entirely correct to say that we can go beyond any given <i>determinate</i> space as well as any <i>determinate</i> time; but it is no less correct to say that space and time are actual only through their determinateness, i.e. as <i>here</i> and <i>now</i>, and that this determinateness is inherent in the concept of them. The same is true of the rest of the remaining antinomies listed earlier, for instance, the antinomy of <i>freedom</i> and <i>necessity</i> with which, looked at more closely, things stand as follows: what the understanding understands by freedom and necessity indeed concerns only the ideal moments of true freedom and true necessity, and the two in their separation amount to nothing true.</div> <h6 id="s49">§49</h6> <div>3. The <i>third</i> object of reason is <i>God</i> (§ 36), who is supposed to be known [<i>erkannt</i>], i.e. <i>determined through thinking</i>. For the understanding, all determination is only a <i>limitation</i> [<i>Schranke</i>] of the simple <i>identity</i>, a negation as such. Thus all reality must be taken to be limitless, i.e. <i>indeterminate</i>, and God as the sum total of all realities or as the most real being [<i>Wesen</i>] becomes the simple <i>abstractum</i>, and for the determination [of God] there is left only the equally completely abstract determinateness, namely, <i>being</i>. Abstract <i>identity</i> (which is also called the concept here) and <i>being</i> are the two moments whose unification is what reason seeks. It is the <i>ideal</i> of reason.</div> <h6 id="s50">§50</h6> <div>There are <i>two</i> possible <i>paths</i> or forms to this unification: one can begin from <i>being</i> and from there make the transition to the <i>abstractum of thinking</i> or, conversely, the transition can be effected from the <i>abstractum</i> to <i>being</i>.<br/>
As far as the beginning with being is concerned, being, as the immediate, presents itself as a being with an infinite variety of determinations, a world completely full. It can be further determined as a collection of infinitely many contingencies in general (as in the <i>cosmological</i> proof), or as a collection of infinitely many <i>purposes</i> and relationships adapted to purposes (as in the <i>physico-teleological</i> proofs). – To <i>think</i> this fullness of being [<i>dieses erfüllte Sein</i>] means to divest its form of individual and contingent [features] and to grasp it as a universal being, different from that first [fullness of being], to grasp it as necessary in and for itself, active and determining itself in accordance with universal purposes – in short, to grasp it as God. – The chief sense of the critique of this path is that it is an act of inferring, a transition. For insofar as <i>perceptions</i> and their aggregate, the world, do not as such exhibit the universality that thinking produces by its purification of that content, this universality is not justified in this way, it is argued, by that empirical representation of the world. Opposed accordingly to this process of thought ascending from the empirical representation of the world to God is the <i>Humean</i> standpoint (as with the paralogisms, see § 47), the standpoint that declares it illicit to <i>think</i> the perceptions, i.e. to lift the universal and necessary out from them. </div> <div class="remark">Since it is the nature of a human being to think, neither healthy common sense nor philosophy will ever allow itself to be kept from elevating itself <i>from</i> and <i>out of</i> the empirical view of the world [<i>Weltanschauung</i>] to God. This elevating has nothing else for its foundation than <i>thoughtful</i> [<i>denkende</i>], not merely sensory or animalistic observation [<i>Betrachtung</i>] of the world. The <i>essence</i>, the <i>substance</i>, the <i>universal power</i> and <i>purposive determination</i> of the world exist for thought and <i>only</i> for thought. The so-called proofs of the existence of God should be viewed merely as <i>descriptions</i> and analyses of <i>the inner route of the spirit</i> who is a <i>thinking</i> spirit and who thinks the sensory [world]. The <i>elevating</i> of spirit above the sensory, its <i>process of going beyond</i> the finite towards the infinite, the <i>leap</i> that is made into the infinite by breaking off the series of sensory [events], all this is thinking itself, this transitioning is <i>nothing but thinking</i>. If such a transition is not supposed to be made, this means that thinking is not supposed to happen. Indeed, the animals do not make such a transition, <i>they</i> stop short at sensory sensation and intuition, and for this reason they have no religion. Two remarks are in order here about the critique of this elevating of thought, both in general and in particular. <i>First</i>, if it is put into the form of <i>syllogisms</i> (so-called <i>proofs</i> of the existence of God), the <i>point of departure</i> is indeed the view of the world that is determined in one way or another as an aggregate of contingencies or purposes and purposive relationships. In thinking, insofar as it <i>syllogises</i>, this point of departure can appear <i>to remain</i> and <i>be left</i> as a <i>fixed foundation</i> and just as empirical as this material at first is. The relationship of the point of departure to the end-point towards which one progresses is thus represented as purely <i>affirmative</i>, as an inferring from <i>one thing</i> that supposedly <i>is</i> and <i>remains</i> to <i>something else</i> that supposedly <i>is as well</i>. Still, it is a grave error to want to recognize the nature of thinking only in the form it takes as understanding. To think the empirical world means, much more essentially, to modify its empirical form and to transform it into a universal. At the same time thinking applies a <i>negative</i> activity to that foundation. When determined by universality, the perceived material <i>does not maintain</i> its initial empirical form. Through elimination and <i>negation</i> of the crust (cf. §§ 13 and 23) the inner <i>basic content</i> [<i>Gehalt</i>] of what is perceived is brought out. The metaphysical proofs of the existence of God are insufficient explanations and descriptions of the elevation of spirit from the world to God for this reason because they do not express or rather bring out the moment of <i>negation</i> that is contained in this elevation. For it is inherent in the fact that the world is <i>contingent</i> [<i>zufällig</i>] that it is merely something <i>incidental</i> [<i>Fallendes</i>], something apparent, something that in and for itself <i>is</i> <i>not</i> [<i>ein Nichtiges</i>]. The sense of the elevation of spirit is that, while being belongs to the world, this being is merely a semblance [<i>Schein</i>], not the true being, not absolute truth, and that this [truth] is instead beyond that appearance in God alone, that God alone truly exists. Insofar as this elevation is <i>transition</i> and <i>mediation</i>, it is equally a <i>sublating</i> of the <i>transition</i> and the mediation. For that through which God could seem to be mediated, i.e. the world, is instead declared to be what is not [<i>das Nichtige</i>]. Only the world's <i>being</i> in this manner of not being [<i>Nichtigkeit</i>] forms the bond of the elevation, such that what exists as the mediating element disappears and, by this means, the mediation is sublated in this mediation itself. – It is chiefly this relationship, conceived merely as affirmative and as a relationship between two beings, to which <i>Jacobi</i> clings, while he combats the constructing of proofs by the understanding. Against it, he rightly objects that <i>conditions</i> (i.e. the world) are thereby sought for the <i>unconditioned</i>, that the <i>infinite</i> (i.e. God) is in this way represented as <i>grounded</i> and <i>dependent</i>. And yet, that elevation as it occurs in spirit by itself corrects this semblance [<i>Schein</i>]; indeed, its entire basic content is the correction of this semblance. But this true nature of essential thinking, to sublate the mediation in the mediation itself, Jacobi failed to recognize. As a consequence, he erroneously mistook the correct objection that he levels against the merely reflective understanding for one that applies to thinking in general and thus also to the thinking based on reason.</div> <div class="remark">As a means of elucidating how the <i>negative</i> moment is overlooked, we can cite as an example the objection made against <i>Spinozism</i>, namely that it is pantheism and atheism. To be sure, the <i>absolute substance</i> of Spinoza is not yet the absolute <i>spirit</i>, and it is rightly demanded that God must be determined as absolute spirit. If, however, Spinoza's determination is represented in such a way that he merges God with nature, i.e. with the finite world, and turns the world into God, it is thereby presupposed that the finite world possesses true actuality, <i>affirmative reality</i>. With this presupposition, to be sure, through the unity of God with the world, God is made utterly finite and downgraded to the merely finite, external manifoldness of existence. Apart from the fact that Spinoza does not define God as the unity of God and the world, but instead as the unity of <i>thinking</i> and extension (the material world), it lies already in this unity, even if taken in this initial, quite awkward way, that in the Spinozistic system the world is in fact determined as a mere phenomenon to which true reality does not pertain, so that this system is to be regarded much more as <i>acosmism</i>. A philosophy that claims that God and <i>only</i> God <i>exists</i> should at least not be passed off as atheism. Even tribes who worship the monkey, the cow, or stone and iron statues, and so forth as God are being credited with having religion. But representation is even more averse to surrendering its own presupposition that its aggregate of finitude called <i>world</i> actually has reality. That <i>there is no world</i>, as representation might express itself, such an assumption is easily held to be completely impossible, or at least to be much less possible than the assumption that might come into one's head that <i>there is no God</i>. One believes, and not exactly to one's credit, much more easily that a system denies God than that it denies the world; one finds it far more conceivable that God is denied than that the world is.</div> <div class="remark">The <i>second</i> remark concerns the critique of the <i>basic content</i> that the thinking elevation [mentioned above] first acquires. This basic content is, of course, not adequate to what is or ought to be understood by God if it consists only in determinations such as the <i>substance</i> of the world, its <i>necessary essence</i>, <i>a cause ordering</i> and <i>directing in a purposeful manner</i>, and so forth. But setting aside the practice of presupposing some representation of God and judging a result according to such a presupposition, the above determinations are indeed of great value and necessary moments of the idea of God. In order to bring the basic content in its true determination, the true idea of God, before thinking in this manner, the point of departure must, of course, not be taken from subordinate content. The <i>merely contingent</i> things of the world are a very abstract determination. The organic creations and determinations of their purposes belong to a higher circle, <i>life</i>. However, apart from the fact that the contemplation of living nature and of the rest of the relationships of things on hand to <i>purposes</i> can be tarnished by the triviality of purposes, or even by childish ways of citing purposes and their relations, nature that is merely alive is indeed itself not yet that from which the true <i>determination</i> of the idea of God can be grasped. God is more than living, he is spirit. The <i>spiritual</i> nature alone is the most dignified and the truest <i>point of departure</i> for thinking the absolute, insofar as thinking takes for itself a point of departure and wants to choose the nearest at hand.</div> <h6 id="s51">§51</h6> <div>The <i>other path of the unification</i> through which the <i>ideal</i> is supposed to come about starts from the <i>abstractum of thought</i> and proceeds to the determination for which only <i>being</i> remains – the <i>ontological proof</i> of the <i>existence of God</i>. The opposition that occurs here is that of <i>thinking</i> and <i>being</i>, since on the first path being is common to both sides and the opposition concerns merely the difference between the individual instance [<i>Vereinzelten</i>] and the universal. What the understanding sets down in opposition to this second path is in itself the same as what was just mentioned, namely, that just as the universal cannot be found in the empirical, so also conversely the determinate is not contained in the universal, and the determinate here is being. Or, being supposedly cannot be derived from the concept or retrieved through analysis of it. </div> <div class="remark">The Kantian critique of the ontological proof has no doubt found such unqualifiedly favourable attention and acceptance because of the example he used. In order to clarify what the difference is between thinking and being, he used the example of the <i>hundred dollars</i> that would be equal to a hundred, whether they be merely possible or real, as far as the <i>concept</i> of them is concerned and yet this would make an essential difference to the state of <i>my</i> resources. – Nothing can be so plain as the fact that what I think or imagine is for all that not yet <i>actual</i>, or so obvious as the thought that representation or even the concept are insufficient to reach being. Ignoring the fact that calling something like a hundred dollars a concept could be justly labelled barbaric, those who repeat again and again against the philosophical idea that <i>thinking</i> and <i>being</i> are <i>different</i> should at long last accept that this is likewise familiar to philosophers. For, is there anything that one is familiar with [<i>Kenntnis</i>] that could indeed be more trivial than that? Next, however, it ought to be considered that when <i>God</i> is under discussion, this is an object of a different kind from a hundred dollars and from <i>any sort of</i> particular concept, representation, or whatever one wants to call it. Indeed, everything <i>finite</i> is like this and this <i>alone</i>, that the <i>existence of it differs from its concept</i>. God, on the other hand, is explicitly supposed to be what can only be '<i>thought as existing</i>', where the concept includes being. This unity of concept and being is what constitutes the concept of God. – To be sure, this is as yet only a formal determination of God, which for this reason contains indeed merely the nature of the <i>concept</i> itself. However, that the latter, even in its entirely abstract sense, already includes <i>being</i> is easy to see. For the concept, however else it may be determined, is at the very least the relation emerging from sublating the mediation and thus the <i>immediate relationship</i> to itself; being, however, is nothing other than this. – One might well say that it would have to be very strange, if the innermost core of spirit (the concept) or if the I, not to mention the concrete totality that is God, were not even so rich as to contain within itself so impoverished a determination as <i>being</i>, which is, after all, the poorest and most abstract determination. In terms of the basic content, there can be nothing more trivial [<i>Geringeres</i>] for thought than <i>being</i>. Only this much may be even more trivial, namely, what one first imagines somehow with respect to being, such as an <i>external, sensory</i> existence like that of the paper here in front of me. But, after all, no one will want to talk about the sensory existence of a limited, transient thing. – Incidentally, the trivial remark of the <i>Critique</i>, that thought and being are different, is able at most to sidetrack but not put an end to the human spirit's progression from the <i>thought</i> of God to the certainty that he <i>exists</i>. It is this transition, too, the inseparability of the thought of God from his being, that has been re-established in its rightful position in the perspective of <i>immediate knowing</i> or <i>belief</i>, of which more will be said later.</div> <h6 id="s52">§52</h6> <div><i>Determinateness</i> remains something <i>external</i> for <i>thinking</i> in this way at its highest point; it continues to be an entirely <i>abstract thinking</i> that is called <i>reason</i> here throughout. Hence, the result is that the latter contributes nothing but the <i>formal unity</i> for the simplification and systematization of experiences. It is a <i>canon</i>, not an <i>organon</i> of <i>truth</i>, and is able to deliver not a <i>doctrine</i> of the infinite, but merely a <i>critique</i> of knowledge. In the final analysis, this critique consists in the <i>assurance</i> that thinking is in itself merely an <i>indeterminate unity</i> and the <i>activity</i> of this <i>indeterminate unity</i>. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. It is true that Kant construed reason as the faculty of the unconditioned. However, if reason is reduced merely to an abstract identity, this at the same time entails renouncing its unconditioned status, and then reason is indeed nothing but empty understanding. Reason is unconditioned only in virtue of the fact that it is not determined from outside by some content alien to it, but instead determines itself and is by this means at home with itself in its content. Now, according to Kant, the activity of reason explicitly consists merely in systematizing the material conveyed by perception and doing so through the application of the categories, that is to say, putting it into some external order, and its principle thereby is merely that of the absence of contradiction.</div> <h6 id="s53">§53</h6> <div>(b) <i>Practical reason</i> is conceived as the will determining itself and, indeed, <i>in a universal manner</i>, i.e. as a <i>thinking</i> will. It is supposed to furnish imperative, objective laws of freedom, i.e. laws that state what <i>ought</i> to happen. The legitimacy of assuming that thinking is an <i>objectively determining</i> activity (i.e. indeed <i>a form of reason</i>), is located in the fact that practical freedom is <i>proven through experience</i>, i.e. that it can be demonstrated in the appearance of self-consciousness. This experience in consciousness is countered by everything that determinism, equally based on experience, brings forward against it, especially the sceptical (also <i>Humean</i>) induction of the <i>infinite diversity</i> of what counts as right and duty among human beings, i.e. as the laws of freedom that are supposed to be objective.</div> <h6 id="s54">§54</h6> <div>As for what practical thought is supposed to make into a law for itself, i.e. the criterion for <i>determining</i> itself within itself, once again nothing is available but the same <i>abstract identity</i> of the understanding, namely, that no contradiction occur in the act of determining. Thus, practical reason does not advance beyond the formalism that is supposed to be the ultimate standpoint of <i>theoretical</i> reason.<br/>
But this practical reason does not merely posit <i>within itself</i> the universal determination, namely <i>the good</i>. Instead it is genuinely <i>practical</i> only in its demand that the good have worldly existence and external objectivity, i.e. that the thought should be not merely <i>subjective</i>, but altogether objective. More about this postulate of practical reason later. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. What Kant had denied theoretical reason, namely free self-determination, he explicitly vindicated for practical reason. It is principally this side of the Kantian philosophy that has won it great favour, and rightly so. In order to recognize the value of our debt to Kant in this respect, we need first to call to mind that shape of the practical philosophy and specifically the moral philosophy that he encountered as the dominant one. This was generally speaking the system of <i>eudaemonism</i>. In reply to the question concerning the vocation of human beings, it answered that they had to aim for <i>happiness</i> as their goal. Now insofar as one understood by happiness the satisfaction of human beings' particular inclinations, wishes, needs, etc., the contingent and the particular were thereby made into the principle of the will and its activity. Kant placed practical reason in opposition to this eudaemonism that dispenses with any firm hold within itself and opens the door to every whim and passing mood, and he enunciated in this way the requirement of a universal determination of the will that was equally binding on everybody. According to Kant, as has been noted in the preceding sections, theoretical reason is supposed to be only the negative faculty of the infinite and, without any positive content of its own, it is supposed to be limited to recognizing the finitude of knowledge of experience. But he explicitly recognized, by contrast, the positive infinity of practical reason and, indeed, in such a way that he ascribes to the <i>will</i> the capacity for determining itself in a universal manner, that is to say, in <i>thinking</i>. The will surely possesses this capacity and it is of enormous importance to know [<i>wissen</i>] that human beings are free only insofar as they possess this capacity and make use of it in their actions. But with this acknowledgment, the question concerning the <i>content</i> of the will or of practical reason is still not answered. When it is then said that human beings ought to make the <i>good</i> the content of their willing, the question of the content, that is to say, the question of the determinateness of this content, immediately recurs, and one does not advance a single step with the mere principle of the agreement of the will with itself or with the requirement to do one's duty for duty's sake.</div> <h6 id="s55">§55</h6> <div>(c) The <i>power of reflective judgment</i> is credited with the principle of an <i>intuiting understanding</i>, in which the <i>particular</i>, which is supposed to be <i>contingent</i> with respect to the <i>universal</i> (i.e. the abstract identity) and not to be derivable from it, is determined by this very universal – something that is said to be experienced in the products of art and of <i>organic</i> nature. </div> <div class="remark">The <i>Critique of the Power of Judgment</i> is distinguished by the fact that in it Kant has articulated the representation, indeed, the thought, of <i>the idea</i>. The representation of an <i>intuitive understanding</i>, of <i>inner purposiveness</i>, etc., is the <i>universal</i> simultaneously thought as <i>concrete</i> in itself. Thus, it is only in these kinds of representations that the Kantian philosophy shows itself to be <i>speculative</i>. Many, notably <i>Schiller</i>, have found in the idea of <i>fine art</i> [<i>des Kunstschönen</i>], i.e. of the <i>concrete</i> unity of thought and sensory representation, the way out from the <i>abstractions</i> of an understanding that separates, while others have found it in the intuition and the consciousness of <i>the state of being alive</i> [<i>Lebendigkeit</i>] in general, be it natural or intellectual life. – To be sure, the product of art and the living individuality are limited in their content. But in the postulated harmony of nature or necessity with the purpose of freedom, i.e. in the conception of the realization of the ultimate purpose of the world, Kant puts forth the idea that is all-encompassing in terms of content as well. And yet, with this highest idea, the laziness of <i>thought</i>, as it may be called, finds in the <i>ought</i> too easy a way out, by holding on to the separation of concept and reality against the actual realization of the ultimate purpose. By contrast, the <i>presence</i> of the living organizations and of the beautiful in the arts demonstrates the <i>actuality</i> of the <i>ideal</i> even for the <i>senses</i> and <i>intuition</i>. The Kantian reflections on these objects would have been particularly suited for introducing consciousness to the process of grasping and thinking the <i>concrete</i> idea.</div> <h6 id="s56">§56</h6> <div>Here the thought of a relationship of the <i>universal</i> of the understanding to the <i>particular</i> of intuition is put forward, one that is different from the relationship that underlies the doctrine of theoretical and practical reason. But no connection is made with the insight that the former relationship is the <i>true</i> one, indeed that it <i>is</i> the <i>truth</i> itself. Instead, this unity is only taken up as it comes to exist in finite appearances and is displayed in <i>experience</i>. Within the <i>subject</i>, such experience is afforded in part by <i>genius</i>, the capacity to produce aesthetic ideas. The latter are representations of the free <i>power of imagination</i> that serve an idea and offer material for <i>thought</i> without expressing that content in a <i>concept</i> or allowing it to be expressed in one. The experience is also afforded by the <i>judgment of taste</i>, the feeling of the <i>harmony</i> of the <i>intuitions'</i> or representations' freedom with the <i>understanding</i> in its conformity to laws.</div> <h6 id="s57">§57</h6> <div>Furthermore, the principle of the reflective power of judgment in relation to the <i>living products of nature</i> is determined as the <i>purpose</i>, the active <i>concept</i>, the universal that is determined and determining in itself. At the same time the idea of an extrinsic or finite purposiveness is removed, i.e. the purposiveness in which the purpose is merely an external form for the means and the material in which it realizes itself. In contrast to this sort of purposiveness, the purpose in <i>living things</i> is a determination and activity immanent in the matter, and all the members exist equally and mutually as means and end [<i>Zweck</i>] for each other.</div> <h6 id="s58">§58</h6> <div>Now the relationship posited by the understanding between means and end, subjectivity and objectivity is sublated in such an idea. Nevertheless and in contradiction again of this fact, the purpose is still declared to be a cause that exists and is active <i>only as a representation</i>, i.e. as something <i>subjective</i>. Thus, the determination of the purpose is also declared to be a principle of judgment, belonging only to <i>our</i> understanding. </div> <div class="remark">Since it is the result of the Critical philosophy anyway that reason can know only appearances, one should still at least have had a choice between two <i>equally subjective</i> ways of thinking about living nature and, in keeping with the Kantian presentation, even an obligation to come to know the products of nature not only according to the categories of quality, cause, and effect, composition, elements, and so forth. If the principle of <i>internal purposiveness</i> had been held on to and developed in its scientific application, it would have yielded an entirely different, higher mode of consideration of the products of nature.</div> <h6 id="s59">§59</h6> <div>In keeping with this principle, the idea in its utter unlimitedness would be that the universality determined by reason, the absolute, ultimate purpose, <i>the good</i>, would be realized in the world and, indeed, through a third factor, the power positing this ultimate purpose and realizing it, namely <i>God</i>, in whom (as the absolute truth) those oppositions of universality and individuality, subjectivity and objectivity are resolved and declared to be not self-standing and to be untrue.</div> <h6 id="s60">§60</h6> <div>However, the <i>good</i> in which the ultimate purpose of the world is located is determined from the start only as <i>our</i> good, as the moral law of <i>our</i> practical reason. As a result, the unity does not extend beyond the agreement of the state of the world and of world events with our morality.<sup><a href="part0016.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ12610" id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ9268">14</a></sup> Moreover, even with this limitation the <i>ultimate purpose</i>, the <i>good</i>, is an undetermined abstractum, as is what <i>duty</i> is supposed to be. More specifically, the opposition, posited as untrue in the harmony's content, is again revived and maintained against this harmony, with the result that the harmony is determined as something merely <i>subjective</i>, something that merely <i>ought</i> to be, that <i>does not</i> possess <i>reality</i>, i.e. as something <i>believed</i>, to which only subjective certainty applies, not truth, i.e. <i>not</i> the objectivity that corresponds to the idea. – If this contradiction seems to be concealed by virtue of the fact that the realization of the idea plays out in <i>time</i>, i.e. in a future in which the idea supposedly also exists, then such a sensory condition as time is rather the opposite of a resolution of the contradiction, and the corresponding representation of the understanding, namely the <i>infinite progression</i>, is at once nothing but the contradiction itself posited as perennially recurring.</div> <div class="remark">A general remark may be added about the outcome that has resulted from the critical philosophy with regard to the nature of <i>knowing</i> [<i>des Erkennens</i>] and that has gained the status of one of the prejudices, i.e. one of the general assumptions of the age. In every dualistic system, and especially in the Kantian system, its basic flaw reveals itself through the inconsistency of <i>combining</i> [<i>vereinen</i>] what a moment ago has been declared to be independent and thus <i>incompatible</i> [<i>unvereinbar</i>]. While what had been combined was just declared to be true, so now instead it is declared to be true that the <i>two moments</i>, whose separate existence on their own has been denied to them in the combination which was to be their truth, possess truth and actuality only insofar as they exist in separation. Such philosophizing as this lacks the simple consciousness that in going back and forth in this way each of these individual determinations is declared to be unsatisfactory, and the flaw consists in the simple inability to bring together two thoughts (and in point of form there are only <i>two</i> of them present). It is therefore the greatest inconsistency to admit, on the one hand, that the understanding acquires knowledge of appearances only, while maintaining, on the other, that this kind of knowledge is something <i>absolute</i> by saying that knowing <i>cannot</i> go further, that this is the <i>natural</i>, absolute <i>barrier</i> [<i>Schranke</i>] for human knowledge [<i>Wissen</i>]. Natural things are limited [<i>beschränkt</i>], and they are merely natural things, insofar as they <i>know</i> [<i>wissen</i>] <i>nothing</i> of their universal <i>barrier</i>, insofar as their determinacy is a barrier only <i>for us</i>, not <i>for them</i>. Something can be known [<i>gewußt</i>], even felt to be a <i>barrier</i>, a lack only insofar as one has at the same time <i>gone beyond</i> it. Living things have the prerogative over lifeless things of feeling pain. For the former, an <i>individual</i> determinateness becomes the sensation of something <i>negative</i>, because, qua alive, they carry within themselves the <i>universality</i> of the living nature that is <i>beyond</i> the individual, they maintain themselves even in the negative of merely themselves, and feel this <i>contradiction</i> as it exists within themselves. This contradiction is in them only insofar as both exist in the <i>one</i> subject, namely the universality of its feeling for life [<i>Lebensgefühl</i>] and the negative individuality opposed to this. A barrier, a lack of knowing is determined precisely <i>to be</i> a barrier or lack only through a <i>comparison</i> with the <i>existing</i> idea of the universal, of what is whole and complete. Therefore, it is merely a lack of consciousness not to realize that the designation of something as finite or limited contains the proof of the <i>actual presence</i> of the infinite, the unlimited, that the knowledge [<i>Wissen</i>] of a boundary can exist only insofar as the unbounded exists <i>on this side</i>, in consciousness.</div> <div class="remark">This <i>further remark</i> may be added about the result concerning knowing, namely that the Kantian philosophy could not have had an influence on the treatment of the sciences. <i>It leaves the categories and the method of ordinary knowing completely unchallenged</i>. In scientific writings of the time, when they now and then start with sentences of the Kantian philosophy, the treatise shows in the sequel that those sentences were merely a superfluous embellishment, and that the same empirical contents would have appeared, if those several initial pages had been dropped.<sup><a href="part0016.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ8854" id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ14262">15</a></sup></div> <div class="remark">As far as the closer comparison of the Kantian philosophy with <i>metaphysicising empiricism</i> is concerned, <i>naïve</i> empiricism, it is true, takes its bearings from sensory perception, but it also allows for a spiritual actuality, a supersensible world, whatever its <i>content</i> may be, whether it stems from thought or fantasy, and so forth. In terms of <i>form</i>, this content has its warrant in spiritual authority, just as the different content of empirical knowledge [<i>Wissen</i>] has it in the authority of outer perception. However, <i>reflective empiricism</i>, making <i>consistency</i> its principle, fights such dualism of the ultimate, highest content and negates the self-sufficiency of the thinking principle and of a spiritual world unfolding in it. <i>Materialism</i>, <i>naturalism</i> is the <i>consistent</i> system of empiricism. – The Kantian philosophy opposes this empiricism with the principle of thought and that of freedom in general, and sides with the first empiricism without in the least stepping outside its [that first empiricism's] general principles. The world of perception and of the understanding reflecting on it continues to exist on one side of its [the Kantian philosophy's] dualism. True, this world is put forward as a world of appearances. However, this is a mere label, a merely formal determination, for the source, substantive content, and manner of examination remain entirely the same. By contrast, on the other side there is the self-sufficiency of thinking that grasps itself, the principle of freedom that it shares with the former, usual metaphysics, but emptied of all content, unable to procure any other for it. This kind of thinking, called <i>reason</i> here, is stripped of all <i>authority</i> by being robbed of every determination. The chief effect that the Kantian philosophy has had is to have awakened consciousness of this absolute interiority. The latter, although unable to develop anything out of itself or to generate any determinations in the way either of knowledge or of moral laws due to its abstraction, nonetheless refuses categorically to acknowledge as valid or let take effect in it anything that has the character of something <i>external</i>. The principle of the <i>independence of reason</i>, of its absolute self-sufficiency within itself, must from now on be regarded as a universal principle of philosophy and equally as one of the prejudices of our time.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 1</i>. The Critical philosophy deserves great negative credit for promoting and validating the conviction that the determinations of the understanding belong to finitude and that a knowing that moves within these limits does not arrive at the truth. And yet, the one-sidedness of this philosophy consists in that the finitude of those determinations of the understanding is attributed to the fact that they pertain to our subjective thinking only, for which the thing-in-itself is supposed to remain an absolute beyond. In fact, however, the finitude of the determinations of the understanding does not lie in their subjectivity. Rather they are in themselves finite, and their finitude needs to be demonstrated in them themselves. According to Kant, however, what we think is false because <i>we</i> think it. – It is to be considered a further deficiency of this philosophy that it offers only a historical description of thinking and a mere list of the moments of consciousness. To be sure, this list is mainly correct, and yet there is no mention of the necessity of what has thus been empirically gathered together. As a result of the reflections about the various levels of consciousness it is then said that the content of what we know [<i>wissen</i>] is only appearance. With this result one must concur, insofar as finite thinking has to do, indeed, only with appearances. Still, this level of appearances is not the end of it; rather there exists a yet higher terrain, which, however, remains an inaccessible beyond for the Kantian philosophy.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 2</i>. While in the Kantian philosophy the principle according to which thinking determines itself out of itself has been established first in a merely formal way, whereas the <i>how</i> and <i>in what respect</i> of this self-determination of thinking has not yet been demonstrated by Kant, it is <i>Fichte</i> who by contrast recognized this defect and who, while expressing the requirement for a deduction of the categories, at the same time undertook the attempt actually to deliver one. The Fichtean philosophy makes the I the point of departure for the philosophical development, and the categories are to emerge as the result of its activity. And yet, the I does not truly appear as a free, spontaneous activity here, since it is considered to be aroused first by a check [<i>Anstoß</i>] from outside itself. The I is then supposed to react against this check, and only through this reaction is it supposed to acquire a consciousness of itself. – With this, the nature of the check remains an unknown outside, and the I continues to be something conditioned having an other over against itself. Consequently, Fichte, too, stands pat with the result of the Kantian philosophy that only the finite can be known, while the infinite passes beyond [the realm of] thinking. What is called 'the thing-in-itself' in Kant is, in Fichte, the check from outside the I, this abstractum of something other than the I that has no other determination than being the negative or the not-I in general. The I is considered here as standing in relation to the not-I through which its self-determining activity is first aroused, and this in such a way that the I is only the continuous activity of freeing itself from the check, without, however, the actual liberation taking place. For with the cessation of the check the I itself, whose being is solely its activity, would cease to exist. Moreover, the content that the activity of the I produces is nothing but the ordinary content of experience, only with the addition that this content is only an appearance.</div> <h2 id="HGL152">C. Third position of thought towards objectivity</h2> <div>Immediate knowing</div> <h6 id="s61">§61</h6> <div>In the Critical philosophy, thinking is construed in such a way that it is <i>subjective</i> and its <i>ultimate</i>, insuperable determination is <i>abstract universality</i>, i.e. formal identity. Thinking is thus placed in opposition to truth as the universality that is in itself concrete. In this highest determination of thinking which is supposed to be reason, the categories do not come into consideration. – The opposite standpoint is to construe thinking as the activity only of <i>the particular</i>, and in this way likewise declare it to be incapable of grasping the truth.</div> <h6 id="s62">§62</h6> <div>As the activity of the particular, thinking has only the <i>categories</i> for its product and content. In the way in which the understanding holds on to them, they are <i>limited</i> determinations, forms of what is <i>conditioned</i>, <i>dependent</i>, <i>mediated</i>. The infinite, the true does not exist for the thinking limited to these determinations. It is incapable of making any transition to the infinite and true (<i>pace</i> the proofs of the existence of God). These determinations of thinking are also called <i>concepts</i>, and to <i>conceptualize</i> an object means nothing but to grasp it under the form of something <i>conditioned</i> and <i>mediated</i>. As a result, insofar as the object is the true, the infinite, the unconditioned, to conceptualize it is to transform it into something conditioned and mediated, and in this way, instead of grasping the true through thinking, to pervert it into something untrue. </div> <div class="remark">This is the sole and simple polemic brought forward by that standpoint which affirms only immediate knowledge of God and of the true. Previously, all kinds of so-called anthropopathic representations were removed from God for being finite and thus unworthy of the infinite, and God grew into a considerably empty entity in the process. However, the determinations of thinking were generally not yet subsumed under the rubric of the anthropopathic. Rather, thinking was held to be such as to strip away the finitude from representations of the absolute – in accordance with the universal prejudice, mentioned above [§ 5], that one arrives at the truth only through thinking things over. Now, finally, the determinations of thinking have also been declared generally to be a kind of anthropopathism and thinking the activity <i>of merely finitizing. –</i> In Appendix VII of the <i>Letters on Spinoza</i>, <i>Jacobi</i><sup><a href="part0016.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ14874" id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ12373">16</a></sup> presented this polemic in the most determinate manner, a polemic he derived from Spinoza's philosophy itself and applied to combating knowing in general. This polemic construes knowing to be of the finite only, as a <i>serial</i> progression in thought, from something <i>conditioned</i> to something else <i>conditioned</i>, in which everything that is a condition is in turn itself only something conditioned – [in other words, a progression] through <i>conditioned conditions</i>. According to this view, explaining and conceptualizing means showing that something is <i>mediated</i> by an <i>other</i>. Thus, all content is only <i>particular</i>, <i>dependent</i>, and <i>finite</i>. The infinite, the true, God lies outside the mechanism of such a connection to which knowing is allegedly restricted. – It is an important point that, while the Kantian philosophy had principally placed the finitude of the categories merely in the formal determination of their <i>subjectivity</i>, in this polemic the categories are discussed with a view to their determinateness and the category as such is recognized as finite. – Jacobi focused in particular on the dazzling successes of the sciences that relate to nature (the <i>sciences exactes</i>), in knowing natural forces and laws. And of course the infinite cannot be found immanently on this plain of the finite; as <i>Lalande</i> [the French astronomer, 1732–1807] said, he searched the entire heaven but did not find God (cf. note in § 60). On this plain, what emerged as the final result was the <i>universal</i> as an <i>indeterminate</i> aggregate of external finite things, i.e. <i>matter</i>. And Jacobi rightly saw no other way out on the path of the mere progression through <i>mediations</i>.</div> <h6 id="s63">§63</h6> <div>At the same time it is maintained that <i>the truth is for the spirit</i>, so much so that it is through <i>reason</i> alone that a human being exists [<i>besteht</i>] and that reason is <i>the knowledge</i> [<i>Wissen</i>] <i>of God</i>. However, because mediated knowledge is supposed to be restricted to finite content alone, reason is <i>immediate knowing</i>, <i>faith</i> [<i>Glaube</i>]. </div> <div class="remark"><i>Knowing</i> [<i>Wissen</i>], <i>believing</i> [<i>Glauben</i>], <i>thinking</i>, <i>intuiting</i> are the categories that obtain for this standpoint, and since they are <i>presupposed</i> as <i>familiar</i> they are simply too often employed arbitrarily, based on mere psychological representations and distinctions. What their nature and concept are, i.e. the only thing that might matter, is not investigated. Thus one finds <i>knowing</i> ordinarily opposed to <i>believing</i>, while believing is at the same time specified as immediate knowing and thus recognized at once as also a kind of knowing [<i>Wissen</i>]. Similarly, it will no doubt be found to be an empirical fact that what one believes is in consciousness, so that at least one <i>knows</i> <i>of it</i>; equally, that what one believes is in consciousness as something <i>certain</i>, so that one therefore knows it. – Moreover, <i>thinking</i> is primarily set in opposition to immediate knowing and believing, and in particular to intuiting. If the intuiting is determined to be <i>intellectual</i>, this can mean nothing but an intuiting that is <i>thinking</i>, unless by 'intellectual' here, where God is the object, one wants to understand fantasies and images as well. In the language of this philosophizing it so happens that believing is also said in reference to the sensory presence of ordinary things. We <i>believe</i>, says Jacobi, that we have a <i>body</i>, we believe in the <i>concrete existence</i> of <i>sensory things</i>. But if the talk is of belief in the true and the eternal, of the fact that God is revealed, given in the immediate knowing, in intuiting, then these are not sensory things but rather a content that is <i>in itself universal</i>, objects only for the spirit <i>that thinks</i>. Again, since what is understood is the I in its <i>singularity</i>, the <i>personality</i>, and to that extent not an <i>empirical</i> I or a <i>particular</i> personality, above all since the personality of God is before consciousness, we are talking about a <i>pure</i> personality, i.e. a personality that is <i>in itself universal</i>, and something of this sort is a thought and belongs only to thinking. – Pure <i>intuiting</i>, moreover, is altogether the same as pure thinking. Initially, 'intuiting' and 'believing' express the specific representations that we connect with these words in ordinary consciousness. In this respect they differ, of course, from thinking, and this difference is intelligible to just about everybody. But believing and intuiting are now supposed to be taken in a higher sense as well, as believing in God, as intellectually intuiting God; in other words, we are supposed to abstract precisely from what constitutes the difference of thinking from intuiting, from believing. It is impossible to say how believing and intuiting, transposed into this higher region, may still differ from thinking. With such differences that have become devoid of meaning, one alleges that one has said and maintained something very important and disputed determinations that are [in fact] the same as those that one has maintained. – The expression 'believing', however, has the particular advantage of reminding us of the <i>Christian</i>, <i>religious</i> faith. It seems to include or even to be practically the same as the latter, so that this faith-based philosophizing appears essentially pious, and pious in a Christian sense, and against the background of this piety allows itself the freedom to offer its random assurances with pretentiousness and authority. One must, however, not let oneself be deceived by the semblance that can sneak in through the mere similarity of the words, but instead hold firmly on to the difference. Christian faith includes within it the authority of the Church; by contrast, the faith of that philosophizing standpoint has only the authority of one's own subjective revelation. Furthermore, that Christian faith is an objective content, rich in itself, a system of doctrine and knowledge. The content of this faith, however, is so indeterminate in itself that, while it will, to be sure, countenance that content in some way, it encompasses just as much the belief that the Dalai Lama, the bull, the monkey, and so forth, is God, and for its own part it restricts itself to the idea of a <i>God in general</i>, a <i>supreme being</i>. The faith in that would-be philosophical sense is itself nothing but the dry <i>abstractum</i> of immediate knowing, a completely formal determination, not to be confused with or mistaken for the spiritual fullness of the Christian faith, either from the side of the believing heart and the Holy Spirit dwelling within it or from the side of a doctrine abounding in content.</div> <div class="remark">Moreover, what is here called believing and immediate knowing is exactly the same as what has also been called inspiration, revelation of the heart, a content implanted by nature in a human being; in particular it is also called sound human understanding, <i>common sense</i> or common sensibility [<i>Gemeinsinn</i>]. In the same way, all these forms make immediacy (the way a content is found in consciousness, the way it is a fact in consciousness) their principle.</div> <h6 id="s64">§64</h6> <div>What this immediate knowing knows is that the infinite, the eternal, the God in our <i>representation</i> also <i>is –</i> that immediately and inseparably bound up with this <i>representation</i> in consciousness is the certainty of its <i>being</i>. </div> <div class="remark">There can be nothing less sensible for philosophy than to want to contradict these propositions of immediate knowing. It could instead congratulate itself on the fact that these, <i>its own</i> old propositions which indeed express its entire universal content, have in any case become to a certain extent the universal philosophical prejudices of our time, even if in such a non-philosophical manner. Rather, one wonders how it could be alleged that these propositions are contrary to philosophy – the propositions that what is held to be true is immanent in spirit (§ 63) and that truth exists for the spirit (ibid.). In a formal respect, the proposition is particularly interesting that God's <i>being</i> is immediately and inseparably bound up with the <i>thought</i> of God and that <i>objectivity</i> is similarly bound up with the <i>subjectivity</i> that attaches at first to thought. Indeed, in its abstraction the philosophy of immediate knowing goes so far as to claim that not only with the thought of God but even in intuition with the <i>representation</i> of my <i>body</i> and of <i>external</i> things the determination of their concrete existence is likewise inseparably conjoined. – If philosophy is intent on proving this unity, i.e. on showing that it is part of the nature of thought or subjectivity itself to be inseparable from being or objectivity, then whatever the standing of such proofs, philosophy must in any case be quite content that it is asserted and shown that its propositions are also <i>facts of consciousness</i> and therefore agree with <i>experience</i>. – The difference between the assertions of immediate knowing and those of philosophy comes down simply to the fact that immediate knowing assumes an <i>exclusive</i> posture, or that it places itself in opposition to philosophizing. – The proposition, <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>, around which, as can be said, all the interest of modern philosophy turns, was also articulated in the form of immediacy by its author. In order to take that proposition for a syllogism, one need not know much more about the nature of the syllogism than that 'ergo' occurs in a syllogism. Where would the <i>medius terminus</i> be? It is, after all, far more essential to a syllogism than the word 'ergo' is. If, however, to justify the name, one wants to call that combination in Descartes an <i>immediate</i> syllogism, then this superfluous form means nothing but a <i>connection of distinct</i> determinations, <i>that is mediated by nothing</i>. But then the connection of being with our representations, expressed by the proposition of immediate knowing, is no more and no less a syllogism. – From Mr Hotho's 1826 dissertation on the <i>Cartesian</i> philosophy, I extract the quotes in which Descartes himself declares explicitly that the proposition <i>cogito, ergo sum</i> is not a syllogism. The passages come from <i>Respons. ad sec. Obiect. [Meditationes]; De Methodo IV; Epistolae I, 118</i>. From the first passage I cite the more precise expressions. Descartes says first that the fact that we are thinking beings is a 'prima quaedam notio quae ex nullo syllogismo concluditur', ['a certain basic notion that is not deduced from any syllogism']; and he continues: 'neque cum quis dicit: ego cogito, ergo sum sive existo, <i>existentiam ex cogitatione per syllogismum</i> deducit' ['if somebody says: “I think, therefore I am or exist”, he does not deduce <i>concrete existence from the thought by means of a syllogism</i>']. Since Descartes knows what is needed for a syllogism, he adds that if there were supposed to be a deduction by means of a syllogism in the case of that proposition, then there would have to be in addition the major premise: 'illud omne, quod cogitat, est sive existit' ['everything that thinks is or exists']. This last proposition, however, is one that could only be derived from that first one.</div> <div class="remark">Descartes's pronouncements about the proposition of the inseparability of myself as a thinking thing from being, that this connection is contained and given in the <i>simple intuition</i> of consciousness, that this connection is absolutely first, a principle, the most certain and the most evident, such that no scepticism can be imagined to be so enormous as to disallow it – these pronouncements are so telling and specific that the modern propositions of Jacobi and others about this immediate connection can count only as superfluous iterations of them.</div> <h6 id="s65">§65</h6> <div>This standpoint is not content with having shown the insufficiency of <i>mediated</i> knowledge [<i>Wissen</i>], taken <i>in isolation</i>, for the truth. Its distinctiveness consists in supposing that <i>immediate</i> knowing has the truth for its content only taken <i>in isolation</i>, to the <i>exclusion</i> of mediation. – In those very exclusions the identified standpoint immediately reveals itself to be a relapse into metaphysical understanding, into its <i>either-or</i>, and thus in fact a relapse even into the relationship of an external mediation based on holding fast to the finite, i.e. to one-sided determinations – the determinations that the view falsely believes that it has placed itself above and beyond. But let us leave this point without developing it further. Exclusively immediate knowing is maintained merely as <i>a fact</i>, and here in the Introduction it only needs to be taken up in accordance with this external reflection. What matters in itself is the logical dimension of the opposition of immediacy and mediation. However, the above standpoint declines to consider the nature of the basic matter, i.e. the concept, because such a consideration leads to mediation and even to knowledge. The true consideration, that of the logical dimension, has to find its place within the science itself. </div> <div class="remark">The entire second part of the Logic, i.e. the doctrine of <i>essence</i>, deals with the essential, self-positing unity of immediacy and mediation.</div> <h6 id="s66">§66</h6> <div>That said, we continue to stand by the position that immediate knowing is to be taken as a <i>fact</i>. With this, however, the consideration is directed towards the field of <i>experience</i>, to a <i>psychological</i> phenomenon. – In this respect, it should be noted that it is one of the most common experiences that truths (which one knows very well to be the result of the most intricate and highly mediated considerations) present themselves <i>immediately</i> in the consciousness of someone conversant with such knowledge. Like everybody else who has been trained in a science, the mathematician immediately has at his fingertips solutions to which a very complicated analysis has led. Every educated person has immediately present in his or her knowing [<i>Wissen</i>] a host of universal viewpoints and principles that have resulted only from repeated reflection and long life experience. The facility we have achieved in any sphere of knowing [<i>Wissen</i>], also in fine art, in technical dexterity, consists precisely in having those sorts of familiarity, those kinds of activity <i>immediately</i> present in one's consciousness in the case at hand, indeed, even in an activity directed outwards and in one's limbs. – In all these cases the immediacy of knowing does not only not exclude its mediation; to the contrary, they are so connected that immediate knowing is even the product and result of knowing [<i>Wissen</i>] that has been mediated. </div> <div class="remark">An equally trivial insight is the connection of immediate <i>concrete existence</i> with its mediation. Seeds, parents are an immediate concrete existence that also initiates existence with respect to their children, etc., who are the ones generated. But the seeds or parents, even though they are <i>immediate</i> in general as concretely existing beings, are likewise generated entities, and the children, etc., despite their concrete existence being mediated, are now immediate, because they <i>are</i>. The fact that I <i>am</i> in Berlin, this my <i>immediate</i> presence, is <i>mediated</i> by the journey undertaken to get here, etc.</div> <h6 id="s67">§67</h6> <div>However, as far as <i>immediately knowing God</i>, <i>legality</i>, and the <i>ethical</i> is concerned (including the other determinations of instinct, implanted, innate ideas, common sense, natural reason, etc.), and whatever form one gives to an original dimension of this sort, it is a universal experience that (even for <i>Platonic recollection</i>) <i>education</i>, development is an essential requirement for bringing to consciousness what is contained therein (Christian baptism itself, although a sacrament, contains the further obligation of a Christian education). This means that as much as religion, ethical life are instances of <i>belief</i>, <i>immediate</i> knowing, they are absolutely conditioned by a mediation that is called variously 'development', 'education', 'formation'.</div> <div class="remark">In the case of the claims on behalf of <i>innate</i> ideas and the objections against them, an opposition of mutually exclusive determinations prevailed that was similar to the one under consideration here. The opposition was, namely, that between – as it may be expressed – the essentially <i>immediate</i> connection of certain general determinations with the <i>soul</i> and another sort of connection that would occur in an external manner mediated by <i>given</i> objects and representations. Against claims for <i>innate ideas</i>, the empirical objection was made that every human being would have to have these ideas, such as the principle of non-contradiction, in their consciousness and would have to know [<i>wissen</i>] them, since this proposition along with others of the same sort was counted among innate ideas. This objection can be said to involve a misunderstanding since the determinations that were meant, while innate, need not for that reason already possess the <i>form</i> of ideas or representations of something known. But against immediate knowing this objection is quite fitting, for this knowing maintains its determinations explicitly insofar as they are supposed to be in consciousness. – When the standpoint of immediate knowing admits that, for religious faith in particular, a development and a Christian or religious education are <i>necessary</i>, then it is mere arbitrariness to want to ignore this again when it comes to talking about believing. Or else, it is thoughtlessness not to know that to admit the necessity of an education is precisely to express the essentialness of mediation.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. When it is said in the Platonic philosophy that we <i>recollect</i> the ideas, this means that the ideas are undeveloped [<i>an sich</i>] in human beings and not (as the Sophists maintained) something foreign to human beings that comes to them from the outside. Yet through this construal of knowing as <i>recollection</i> the development of what is <i>undeveloped</i> in human beings is not ruled out, and this development is nothing but mediation. It is the same with the <i>innate ideas</i> that come up in Descartes and the Scottish philosophers. They are equally to be regarded as being initially present only <i>as undeveloped</i> and in the manner of a disposition in human beings.</div> <h6 id="s68">§68</h6> <div>In the experiences mentioned, appeal is made to what shows itself to be <i>bound up</i> with immediate knowing. If this bond is taken at first to be only an <i>external</i> or empirical connection, it nonetheless proves to be essential and inseparable even for the empirical consideration, because it is invariable. But furthermore, when in accordance with experience this immediate knowing is taken on its own terms [<i>für sich</i>], insofar as it is knowledge [<i>Wissen</i>] of God and the divine, this sort of consciousness is generally described as an <i>elevation above</i> the sensory and finite as well as above the immediate desires and inclinations of the natural heart – an elevation that passes over into faith in God and the divine and terminates in them, so that this faith is an immediate knowing and believing [<i>Fürwahrhalten</i>] but nonetheless has taken the route of mediation as its presupposition and condition. </div> <div class="remark">It has already been noted that the so-called proofs of the existence of God that start with finite being express this elevation. They are not the inventions of an artificial reflection but the spirit's own, necessary mediations, even if they do not find their complete and correct expression in the ordinary form of those proofs.</div> <h6 id="s69">§69</h6> <div>The transition (designated in § 64) from the subjective idea to being constitutes the main interest from the standpoint of immediate knowing, and the claim is made that this transition is essentially an original connection, devoid of mediation. Without paying any regard to seemingly empirical bonds, this central point exhibits the mediation <i>in it</i> [i.e. in that standpoint] itself and, indeed, in that mediation's true determination, not as a mediation with and through something external, but as establishing itself in itself [<i>sich in sich selbst beschließend</i>].</div> <h6 id="s70">§70</h6> <div>The claim made from this standpoint is that neither the <i>idea</i> as a merely <i>subjective</i> thought nor a being solely for itself is what is true [<i>das Wahre</i>]. The being that is solely for itself, a being that is not that of the idea, is the sensory, finite being of the world. In this way, then, it is immediately claimed that only the idea <i>mediated</i> by being and, conversely, only the being <i>mediated</i> by the idea <i>is the true</i>. The proposition of immediate knowing rightly seeks not the indeterminate, empty immediacy, the abstract being or pure unity for itself, but instead the unity of <i>the idea</i> with being. But it is thoughtless not to see that the unity of <i>distinct</i> determinations is not just a purely immediate, i.e. completely indeterminate and empty unity, but instead that precisely in that unity it is posited that one determination possesses truth only by virtue of being mediated by the other or, if you like, that each is mediated with the truth only through the other. – By this means, it is thus shown to be a <i>fact</i> that the determination of a mediation is contained in that immediacy itself and the <i>understanding</i>, in keeping with its own principles of immediate knowing, should have nothing to object to this <i>fact</i>. It is only the ordinary abstract understanding that regards the determinations of immediacy and mediation each for itself as absolute and supposes itself to have a <i>firm</i> distinction in them. Thus it generates for itself the insuperable difficulty of uniting them, a difficulty that, as has been shown, is not on hand in the fact and, to the same extent, disappears in the speculative concept.</div> <h6 id="s71">§71</h6> <div>The one-sidedness of this standpoint brings with it determinations and consequences and, following the discussion of the foundation, the task remains of drawing attention to their main features. <i>First</i>, because the <i>fact of consciousness</i> rather than the <i>nature of the content</i> is set up as the criterion of truth, the basis for what is alleged be true is <i>subjective</i> knowing [<i>Wissen</i>] and the <i>assurance</i> that I find a certain content in <i>my</i> consciousness. What I find in <i>my</i> consciousness is thereby inflated to mean what is found in <i>everyone's</i> consciousness and alleged to be the <i>nature</i> of consciousness itself. </div> <div class="remark">In previous times, the <i>consensus gentium</i> [the consensus of peoples], to which Cicero already appealed, was listed among the so-called proofs of the existence of God. The <i>consensus gentium</i> is a considerable authority, and the transition from saying that some content is found in <i>everyone's</i> consciousness to saying that it is part of the nature of consciousness itself and a necessary part of it is not far-fetched. Inherent in this category of <i>universal</i> agreement was the essential consciousness, not escaping even the most uncultivated human sensibility, that the consciousness of the individual is at the same time something <i>particular, contingent</i>. If the nature of this consciousness is not itself investigated, i.e. if the particular and the contingent are not set apart from it (a laborious operation of thinking things through and the only means of finding out what is in and of itself universal in it), then only <i>everyone's</i> agreement about a given content can ground a respectable prejudice to the effect that that content is part of the nature of consciousness itself. To be sure, thinking needs to know [<i>wissen</i>] that what shows itself to be <i>universally</i> on hand is <i>necessary</i>, and the <i>consensus communis</i> does not suffice for this. But even within the limits of the assumption that the universality of the fact would be a satisfactory proof, it has been abandoned as a proof of this belief, because of the experience that there are individuals and peoples in whom belief in God is not found.<sup><a href="part0016.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ9659" id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ11230">17</a></sup> But nothing is quicker and more convenient than to have given the mere <i>assurance</i> that I find some content in my consciousness together with the certainty of its truth, and that therefore this certainty is inherent, not in me as a particular subject, but in the nature of spirit itself.</div> <h6 id="s72">§72</h6> <div><i>Second</i>, from the fact that <i>immediate knowing</i> is supposed to be the criterion of truth, it follows that all kinds of superstition and idolatry are declared to be true, and the most unjust and the most unethical content of the will is justified. The cow, the monkey, or the Brahman or Lama do not count as God for the Indian thanks to so-called mediated knowledge, reasoning, and syllogism; instead he <i>believes</i> it. However, natural desires and inclinations of themselves infuse consciousness with their interests, and the immoral purposes are present in it in a completely immediate way. The good or evil character would express the <i>determinate being</i> [<i>das bestimmte Sein</i>] of the will, which may be recognized in the [corresponding] interests and purposes, and recognized, to be sure, in the most immediate way.</div> <h6 id="s73">§73</h6> <div>Finally, immediate knowledge of God is supposed to extend only to the fact <i>that</i> God exists, not <i>what</i> God is, for the latter would be a process of knowing [<i>Erkenntnis</i>] and would lead to mediated knowledge [<i>Wissen</i>]. By this means, God as the object of religion is explicitly limited to <i>God in general</i>, to the indeterminate supersensory domain, and religion's content is reduced to a minimum. </div> <div class="remark">If it were actually necessary to effect only this much, namely, preserving the belief that <i>there is a God</i> or even establishing such a belief, one would still have to be amazed at the poverty of the age, willing as it is to count the most impoverished religious knowledge as a gain and having reached the point of returning in its church to the altar that had long since existed in <i>Athens –</i> dedicated <i>to the unknown God!</i></div> <h6 id="s74">§74</h6> <div>The general nature of the <i>form of immediacy</i> remains to be indicated briefly. For it is this very form which, because it is <i>one-sided</i>, renders its content one-sided as well and thus <i>finite</i>. To the <i>universal</i> it gives the one-sidedness of an <i>abstraction</i>, so that God becomes an essence devoid of any determination. But God can be called spirit only insofar as he is known [<i>gewußt</i>] as <i>mediating himself</i> in his very self <i>with himself</i> [<i>sich</i> in sich selbst <i>mit sich vermittelnd</i>]. Only in this way is he <i>concrete</i>, alive, and spirit. For this reason, <i>knowing</i> [<i>wissen</i>] God as spirit contains mediation within itself. – The form of immediacy confers on the <i>particular</i> the determination to <i>be</i>, or to relate <i>itself to itself</i>. The particular, however, is precisely the relating of itself to an <i>other</i> outside it. Through that form [of immediacy], the <i>finite</i> is posited as absolute. Since, as utterly abstract, it is <i>indifferent</i> to <i>any content</i> and for that very reason receptive to any content, it is just as capable of sanctioning an idolatrous and immoral content as the opposite. Only the insight into that content, namely that it is not self-sufficient but <i>mediated by an other</i>, relegates it to its finitude and untruth. Since the content carries mediation with it, this sort of insight is a way of knowing [<i>Wissen</i>] that contains mediation. A content can be recognized as genuinely true [<i>das Wahre</i>] only insofar as it is not mediated by an other, is not finite, and thus mediates itself with itself and so is mediation and immediate relation to itself in one. – The understanding that supposes it has freed itself from finite knowing [<i>Wissen</i>], from <i>the identity of the understanding</i> characteristic of metaphysics and the Enlightenment, immediately re-makes this <i>immediacy</i>, i.e. <i>the abstract relation to itself</i>, the abstract identity, into the principle and criterion of truth. <i>Abstract thinking</i> (the form of reflective metaphysics) and <i>abstract intuiting</i> (the form of immediate knowing) are one and the same. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. Because it is firmly maintained in opposition to the form of mediation, the form of immediacy is accordingly one-sided, and this one-sidedness is communicated to any content that is merely reduced to this form. Immediacy is in general an abstract relation to itself and thus at the same time abstract identity, abstract universality. If what is universal in and of itself is taken only in the form of immediacy, it is then merely the abstract universal and, from this standpoint, God acquires the significance of a completely indeterminate essence. If one then still speaks of God as spirit, this is only an empty word, for in any case spirit as consciousness and self-consciousness is a process of distinguishing itself from itself and from an other, and thus at the same time a mediation.</div> <h6 id="s75">§75</h6> <div>The <i>assessment</i> of this third position attributed to thinking in relation to truth could only be undertaken in a manner that this standpoint immediately refers to and acknowledges in itself. It has been shown to be <i>factually</i> [<i>faktisch</i>] wrong that there <i>is</i> an immediate knowing, a knowing that is without mediation, whether it be with an other or with itself in it [that knowing] itself. It has been likewise explained to be factually untrue that thinking progresses <i>exclusively</i> through determinations <i>mediated by something else</i>, i.e. finite and conditioned ones, and that this mediation does not just as much sublate itself in the mediation. But the Logic and the <i>entire philosophy exemplify</i> the <i>fact</i> that there is a kind of knowing that proceeds neither in one-sided immediacy nor in one-sided mediation.</div> <h6 id="s76">§76</h6> <div>If the principle of immediate knowing is considered in relation to the point of departure (the earlier so-called <i>naïve</i> metaphysics), the result of the comparison is the same principle's <i>return</i> to the beginning that this metaphysics made in modern times as the <i>Cartesian</i> philosophy. Both maintain: </div> <div class="remark">1. The plain inseparability of <i>thinking</i> and the <i>being</i> of the thinker – <i>cogito ergo sum</i> is completely the same as [the fact] that the being, reality, concrete existence of the I are immediately revealed to me in consciousness (in <i>Principia philosophiae</i> I, 9, Descartes explicitly declares at once that by thinking he understands <i>consciousness</i> in general and as such), and that this inseparability is the absolutely <i>first</i> (not mediated, not proven) and <i>most certain</i> knowledge.</div> <div class="remark">2. Similarly, the inseparability of the representation of <i>God</i> and his <i>concrete existence</i>, so that the latter is contained in the very representation of God and there is absolutely no such representation without the determination of concrete existence, which is thus a necessary and eternal one.<sup><a href="part0016.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ14843" id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ10558">18</a></sup></div> <div class="remark">3. As far as the equally immediate consciousness of the concrete existence of <i>external</i> things is concerned, this means nothing but <i>sensory</i> consciousness. That we possess such a consciousness is the slightest instance of knowledge. The only thing of interest here is knowing that this manner of immediately knowing the <i>being</i> of external things is deception and error, and that in the sensory realm as such there is no truth; rather, the <i>being</i> of these external things is purely contingent, transitory, a <i>semblance</i>, i.e. that they are essentially such as to have a concrete existence that is separable from their concept, their essence.</div> <h6 id="s77">§77</h6> <div>The two standpoints are nonetheless different: </div> <div class="remark">1. From these unproven presuppositions, assumed to be unprovable, the Cartesian philosophy moves <i>on to further</i>, developed knowledge and by doing so has provided the origin for the sciences of the new era. By contrast, the modern standpoint has arrived at the result, important in its own right [<i>für sich</i>] (§ 62), that knowing which proceeds along <i>finite</i> mediations knows only the finite and contains no truth, and it demands that the consciousness of God stand pat with the above-mentioned quite abstract faith.<sup><a href="part0016.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ9621" id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ11173">19</a></sup></div> <div class="remark">2. On the one hand, in this process the modern standpoint does not change anything in the method, introduced by Descartes, of ordinary scientific knowing, and it continues entirely in the same way to pursue those sciences of the empirical and the finite that originated from that method. On the other hand, however, this standpoint discards this method and in the process, since it has no inkling of any other method, it discards <i>all</i> methods for knowing [<i>Wissen</i>] what is, in terms of its basic content, infinite. As a result, it gives itself over to the wild arbitrariness of imaginings and assurances, to moral self-conceit and the arrogance of sentiments or to an opining and rationalizing lacking any measure, while declaring itself most vehemently against philosophy and philosophical claims. For philosophy permits neither a mere offering of assurances, nor imaginings, nor the arbitrary back-and-forth thinking characteristic of rationalization [<i>Räsonnement</i>].</div> <h6 id="s78">§78</h6> <div>The <i>opposition</i> between a self-standing immediacy of content or knowing and a mediation that is equally self-standing but incompatible with the former must be set aside, for one thing because it is a mere <i>presupposition</i> and an arbitrary <i>assurance</i>. Similarly, all other presuppositions or prejudices must be surrendered at the entry to science, whether they be taken from representation or from thought. For it is in science that all such determinations must first be examined and the status of them and their oppositions recognized. </div> <div class="remark"><i>Scepticism</i>, as a negative science applied to all forms of knowing, would present itself as an introduction in which the vacuousness [<i>Nichtigkeit</i>] of such presuppositions would be exposed. But this path would be not only unpleasant but also superfluous since the dialectical element is itself an essential moment of the affirmative science, as will be noted in a moment. Moreover, scepticism would have to find the finite forms in a merely empirical and unscientific way and take them up as a given. The demand for such a consummate scepticism is the same as the demand that science ought to be preceded by <i>doubting everything</i>, i.e. by the complete <i>absence of any presupposition</i>. This demand is actually fulfilled in the resolve <i>to engage in pure thinking</i> and through the freedom that abstracts from everything and grasps its pure abstraction, the simplicity of thinking.</div> <div id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ10720">More detailed conception and division of the Logic</div> <h6 id="s79">§79</h6> <div>In terms of form, the logical domain has three sides: (α) <i>the abstract</i> side or that of the <i>understanding</i>, (β) <i>the dialectical</i> or <i>negatively rational</i> side, (γ) <i>the speculative</i> or <i>positively rational</i> side. </div> <div class="remark">These three sides do not constitute three <i>parts</i> of logic, but are <i>moments of every properly logical content</i> [<i>Momente jedes Logisch-Reellen</i>], that is to say, of every concept or everything true in general. They can all be brought under the first moment, i.e. <i>that of the understanding</i>, and thus separated and kept apart, but in this way they are not considered in their truth. – Like the division, the statement made here about the determinations of the logical is at this point only anticipatory and historical.</div> <h6 id="s80">§80</h6> <div>(α) Thinking as <i>understanding</i> does not budge beyond the firm determinateness [of what is entertained] and its distinctness over against others. A limited abstraction of this sort counts for it as self-standing and [as having] being [<i>als für sich bestehend und seiend</i>]. </div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. When one speaks of thinking in general or more specifically of comprehending [<i>Begreifen</i>], one often tends to have in mind only the activity of the understanding. Now, admittedly, thinking is at first a thinking by way of understanding. However, it does not stand still with this, and the concept [<i>Begriff</i>] is not a mere determination of the understanding. – The understanding's activity generally consists in imparting the form of universality to its contents. More precisely, the universal posited by the understanding is an abstract universal which, as such, is maintained in opposition to the particular and by that very fact is determined at the same time to be itself a particular in turn. By relating to its objects by separating and abstracting [them], the understanding is the opposite of immediate intuition and sensation which as such deal with the concrete throughout and do not budge beyond it.<br/>
Those oft-repeated reproaches that generally tend to be made against thinking refer to this opposition between the understanding and sensation, reproaches that come down to saying that thinking is rigid and one-sided and, as a consequence, leads to pernicious and destructive results. Insofar as those reproaches are justified in terms of their contents, the response to them has to be first that it is not thinking in general, and more specifically rational thought, that is subject to them, but only the thinking of the understanding. Furthermore, the thinking that is performed merely by the understanding must above all be accorded its rights and its merits. These consist in the fact that neither in the theoretical nor in the practical field is it possible to arrive at any firmness and determinateness without the understanding. First, as far as knowing is concerned, it starts by apprehending the objects on hand in terms of their determinate differences. Thus, in the contemplation of nature, for instance, matters, forces, genera, etc. are distinguished and fixed as such [<i>für sich</i>] in this their isolation. Thinking proceeds here as understanding, and its principle is identity, the simple relation to itself. This identity then also conditions the further progression from one determination to another in knowing. Thus notably in mathematics magnitude is <i>the</i> determination along which one proceeds while leaving all others out. Accordingly, in geometry one compares figures with each other by emphasizing what is identical between them. In other domains of knowing, too, such as in jurisprudence, one proceeds in accordance with identity at first. Here, inferring one determination from another is nothing but a progression in accordance with the principle of identity. – In the practical sphere no less than in the theoretical sphere, the understanding is indispensable. Action essentially requires character, and a person [<i>Mensch</i>] of character is a human being who understands and, as such, eyes determinate purposes and firmly pursues them. Someone who wants to do something great must know, as Goethe says, how to limit himself. By contrast, someone who wants everything in fact wants nothing and accomplishes nothing. There are a lot of interesting things in the world: Spanish poetry, chemistry, politics, music. All of that is very interesting, and one cannot blame anybody who takes an interest in them. However, if as an individual one wants to achieve something in a particular situation, one must stick to something determinate and not split up one's power in various directions. Similarly, in every profession the point is to pursue it with understanding. Thus, a judge, for instance, must adhere to the law, pass judgment in accordance with it, avoid being distracted by this and that, refuse to accept any excuses, and act without looking right or left. – Furthermore, the understanding generally represents an essential aspect of education [<i>Bildung</i>]. An educated person is not satisfied with nebulous and vague things; instead, he grasps the objects in their firm determinacy, whereas the uneducated vacillate back and forth with uncertainty, and it often takes a great deal of effort to reach an agreement with such a person about the topic of the discussion and bring him to keep his eyes unerringly on the specific point dealt with.<br/>
Now furthermore, and following our earlier examination, since the logical sphere in general is to be construed not merely as a subjective activity, but instead as absolutely universal and therefore at the same time as objective, this is to be applied to the understanding as the first form of the logical as well. The understanding is thus to be regarded as analogous to what one calls the <i>loving kindness</i> [<i>Güte</i>] of God, insofar as we understand by this that finite things <i>are</i>, that they have a standing. Thus, for instance, in nature one recognizes the loving kindness of God in that the diverse classes and genera of both animals and plants have been endowed with everything they need in order to preserve themselves and flourish. It is the same with human beings, too, with individuals and entire peoples, who also partly find what is necessary for their continued existence and development as something immediately on hand (such as, for instance, the climate, composition, and products of the land) and partly possess it in the form of disposition and talent. Construed in this way, the understanding shows itself in every domain of the objective [<i>gegenständlich</i>] world, and it belongs essentially to the perfection of an object that the principle of the understanding receive its due in it. Thus, for instance, the state is imperfect if a specific differentiation of estates and professions has not yet emerged in it, and if the political and governmental functions that differ in accordance with the concept have not yet been formed into specific organs in the same way as is the case in the developed animal organism with its different functions of sensation, movement, digestion, etc. – From the discussion so far we learn, furthermore, that even in such domains and spheres of activity that, according to the ordinary representation of things, seem to be furthest removed from the understanding, the latter must nonetheless not be absent, and that to the extent that this is the case, it must be regarded as a defect. This is notably true of art, religion, and philosophy. Thus, for instance, in art the understanding is evident in the way that the forms of the beautiful, differing conceptually as they do, are also maintained and exhibited in terms of this difference of theirs. The same is true of individual works of art. Thus it is characteristic of the beauty and perfection of a drama that the characters of the different personae are portrayed in their purity and determinacy, and also that the several goals and interests that are at play are presented clearly and decisively. – Next, insofar as the domain of the religious is concerned, the advantage of Greek over Nordic mythology, for example (apart from the diversity otherwise of content and conception), consists essentially in that in the former the figures of the individual gods are developed to the point of having a sculpted determinacy [<i>plastische Bestimmtheit</i>], whereas in the latter they merge together in the fog of a murky indeterminacy. – Finally, given what has been discussed up to this point, the fact that philosophy also cannot dispense with the understanding scarcely needs any particular mention. To do philosophy, it is above all required that each thought be grasped in its full precision and that one is not content with vagueness and indeterminacy.<br/>
It also, however, tends to be said that the understanding must not go too far. This is correct, insofar as the point of view of the understanding [<i>das Verständige</i>] is not something ultimate but far more something finite instead, and, more specifically, something of the sort that, pushed to the extreme, turns over into its opposite. It is the way of youth to relish abstractions, whereas a person with the experience of life does not indulge in the abstract <i>either-or</i>, clinging instead to what is concrete.</div> <h6 id="s81">§81</h6> <div>(β) The <i>dialectical</i> moment is the self-sublation of such finite determinations by themselves and their transition into their opposites.</div> <div class="remark">1. The dialectical, when taken in isolation by the understanding, constitutes <i>scepticism</i>, particularly when displayed in scientific concepts. It contains mere negation as the result of the dialectical. 2. The dialectic is usually regarded as an extraneous art that arbitrarily generates confusion among certain concepts and a mere <i>semblance</i> of <i>contradictions</i> among them, such that not these determinations but instead this semblance is supposedly something null and void and, in contrast to it, what belongs to the understanding is supposedly what is true. Furthermore, the dialectic is often nothing more than a subjective seesaw system of back-and-forth rationalizing, where the basic content is missing and this paucity is concealed by the astuteness that generates such rationalizing. – In its distinctive determinateness, the dialectic is far more the proper, true nature of the determinations of the understanding, of things, and of the finite in general. Reflexion is at first a process of going beyond the isolated determinacy, i.e. a relating of it, whereby it is brought into a relationship, despite its being maintained in its isolated validity. The dialectic is, by contrast, this <i>immanent</i> process of going beyond [such determinacy] wherein the one-sided and limited character of the determinations of the understanding presents itself as what it is, namely as their negation. Everything finite is this, the sublating of itself. Thus, the dialectical moment constitutes the moving soul of the scientific progression and is the principle through which alone <i>an immanent connection and necessity</i> enters into the content of science, just as in general the true, as opposed to an external, elevation above the finite resides in this principle.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 1</i>. Properly construing and recognizing the dialectical dimension is of the highest importance. It is in general the principle of all movement, all life, and all actual activity. The dialectical is equally the soul of all truly scientific knowing. In our ordinary consciousness, not stopping short at the abstract determinations of the understanding appears to be only fair, in keeping with the adage 'Live and let live', such that one thing is valid, but <i>so, too, is the other</i>. Looked at more closely, however, the finite is not limited merely from the outside but, by virtue of its own nature, sublates itself and changes into its opposite on account of itself. Thus, for example, it is said that human beings are mortal, and dying is then regarded as something that has its cause in extraneous circumstances only. According to this way of viewing the matter, a human being has two particular properties, that of being alive and <i>also</i> that of being mortal. The true way to construe the matter, however, is that life as such carries within itself the germ of death and that, generally speaking, the finite contradicts itself in itself and for that reason sublates itself. – Furthermore, the dialectic must not be confused with mere <i>sophistic</i> technique, the essence of which consists precisely in upholding one-sided and abstract determinations in isolation from one another, depending on the individual's respective interests and particular situation. Thus, for example, in regard to action, it is essential that I exist and have the means to exist. But if I then lay emphasis exclusively on this side, this principle of my wellbeing, and derive from it the conclusion that I am therefore allowed to steal or betray my fatherland, this is sophistry. – Similarly in my actions my subjective freedom is an essential principle in the sense that I am engaged with insight and conviction in what I do. However, if I reason on the basis of this principle <i>alone</i>, then this is likewise sophistry and all principles of ethical life are thereby thrown overboard. – The dialectic differs essentially from such behaviour, for it aims precisely at contemplating things as they are in and for themselves, and from this emerges the finitude of the one-sided determinations of the understanding. – Incidentally, the dialectic is nothing new in philosophy. Among the ancients, Plato is called the inventor of the dialectic, and rightfully so, insofar as in the Platonic philosophy the dialectic occurs for the first time in its free, scientific and thus at the same time objective form. With Socrates, the dialectical still has a predominantly subjective shape, namely that of <i>irony</i>, in keeping with the general character of his philosophizing. Socrates directed his dialectic against the ordinary consciousness in general and then against the Sophists in particular. In his conversations, he would assume the guise of someone who wanted to be instructed further about the matter under discussion. In this context he raised all sorts of questions and led those with whom he conversed to the opposite of what at first had seemed to them to be right. When, for instance, the Sophists called themselves teachers, Socrates would, through a series of questions, get the sophist Protagoras to admit that all learning is merely recollection. – In Plato's rigorous, scientific dialogues, by means of the dialectical treatment, he shows the finitude of all fixed determinations of the understanding in general. Thus, in the <i>Parmenides</i>, for instance, he derives the One from the Many and, in spite of this, shows how the Many is just this, namely to determine itself as the One. Plato treated the dialectic in this grand manner. – In more recent times, it was primarily Kant who brought back to memory the dialectic and reinstated it in its position of honour. He did this by elaborating the so-called antinomies of reason that we have already discussed (§ 48). In their case, in no way is it a matter of merely going back and forth between reasons and of a merely subjective activity. It is rather a matter of showing how each abstract determination of the understanding, taken merely in the way it presents itself, immediately turns over into its opposite. – Now however much the understanding is prone to resist the dialectic, the latter is by no means to be regarded as present only for the philosophical consciousness. Instead, what is in play here is already found in all other forms of consciousness and is found universally in experience. Everything that surrounds us can be viewed as an example of the dialectic. We know that all finite things, instead of being something fixed and ultimate, are really changeable and perishable, and this is nothing but the dialectic of the finite. By virtue of this dialectic, the same thing (as in itself the other of itself) is driven beyond what it immediately is and turns over into its opposite. Whereas earlier (§ 80) it was said the understanding should be regarded as what is contained in the representation of God's <i>goodness</i>, so now it should be noted in the same (objective) sense about the dialectic that its principle corresponds to the representation of God's <i>power</i>. We say that all things (i.e. everything finite as such) come to judgment, and with this we have a view of the dialectic as the universal, irresistible power which nothing, however secure and firm it may feel itself to be, can withstand. To be sure, the depth of the divine being, God's concept, is not yet exhausted by this determination. Still, it forms an essential moment in all religious consciousness. – Furthermore, the dialectic also establishes itself in all the particular domains and formations of the natural and the spiritual world as, for instance, in the movement of the celestial bodies. A planet stands now in this location, but it is in itself such as to be in a different location as well, and it brings its otherness into existence by undergoing movement. Similarly, the physical elements prove to be dialectical, and the metereological process is the manifestation of their dialectic. It is the same principle that forms the basis of all other processes in nature and through which nature is at the same time driven beyond itself. As far as the occurrence of the dialectic in the spiritual world, and more specifically in the legal and the ethical domain is concerned, one need only be reminded of how, as follows from experience universally, the extremes of a state or an action tend to change into their opposite, a dialectic that proverbs acknowledge in multiple ways. Thus, for instance, it is said that <i>summum ius summa iniuria</i> ['utmost justice is the utmost injustice'] as a means of expressing that abstract justice, driven to the extreme, changes over into injustice. So, too, it is well known how in the area of politics the extremes of anarchy and despotism tend to provoke one another reciprocally. We find consciousness of the dialectic in the ethical domain, as far as its individual form is concerned, in the well-known proverbs: 'Pride goes before a fall', 'Too much wit outwits itself', etc. – Even feelings, bodily as well as mental, possess a dialectic of their own. It is well known how the extremes of pain and joy turn into one another; the heart filled with joy relieves itself through tears, and in some circumstances the most poignant melancholy tends to announce itself with a smile.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition 2</i>. Scepticism must not be regarded merely as a doctrine of doubt. Rather, it is absolutely certain of the matter it is concerned with, namely the nothingness of all things finite. The person who is still doubting continues to harbour the hope that his doubt can be lifted and that one or the other of the determinate points between which he is vacillating will turn out to be firm and true. By contrast, scepticism proper is the complete despair of anything solid in understanding and the attitude that results from it is an unshakeable mind that rests in itself. This is the high-minded ancient scepticism as we find it presented notably in Sextus Empiricus and as it developed as a complement to the dogmatic systems of the Stoics and Epicureans during the later Roman period. We must not confuse this high-minded ancient scepticism with the modern scepticism already mentioned earlier (§ 39) that partly preceded and partly developed out of the Critical philosophy. This modern scepticism consists simply in denying the truth and certainty of the supersensory domain and in designating the sensory and what is on hand in immediate sensation as what we have to cling to.<br/>
Incidentally, if scepticism is often regarded even today as an irresistible enemy of all positive knowing [<i>Wissen</i>] whatsoever and thus also of philosophy, insofar as the latter deals with positive knowledge [<i>Erkenntnis</i>], then it needs to be said in response that it is in fact only the finite, abstract thinking of the understanding that has to fear scepticism and cannot withstand it, whereas philosophy, by contrast, contains the sceptical within itself as one of its moments, namely as the dialectical. But then philosophy does not rest with the merely negative result of the dialectical as is the case with scepticism. The latter misjudges its result by clinging to it as a mere (i.e. abstract) negation. Because the dialectic has the negative as a result, the negative is equally positive, precisely as a result, for it contains within itself that from which it results, containing the latter as something it has sublated, and is not without what it has sublated. This, however, is the fundamental determination of the third form of the logical, namely of the <i>speculative</i> or positively rational.</div> <h6 id="s82">§82</h6> <div>(γ) The <i>speculative</i> or the <i>positively rational</i> grasps the unity of the determinations in their opposition, the <i>affirmative</i> that is contained in their dissolution and their passing over into something else.</div> <div class="remark">1. The dialectic has a <i>positive</i> result, because it has a <i>determinate content</i> or because its result is in truth not an <i>empty, abstract nothing</i>, but instead the negation of <i>definite determinations</i> that are contained in the result precisely because it is not an <i>immediate nothing</i>, but a result instead. 2. Therefore, although it is something thought, even abstract, the rational is at the same time something <i>concrete</i>, because it is not a <i>simple</i>, <i>formal</i> unity, but a <i>unity of distinct determinations</i>. For this reason, philosophy does not deal at all with mere abstractions or formal thoughts, but exclusively with concrete thoughts. 3. The mere <i>logic of the understanding</i> is contained in the speculative logic and can instantly be extracted from it. Nothing more is needed for this than to remove the dialectical and the rational from it. In this way, it becomes what the <i>ordinary logic</i> is, namely a <i>historical record</i> of diverse, juxtaposed determinations of thought that in their finitude count as something infinite.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. In terms of <i>content</i>, the rational is so far from being the possession merely of philosophy that it must be said instead that it is available to all human beings at whichever level of education and mental development they may find themselves. In this sense, human beings have, since ancient times, rightly been designated as rational beings [<i>Wesen</i>]. The general empirical manner in which the rational is known [<i>wissen</i>] is at first that of prejudice and presupposition and, according to our previous discussion (§ 45), the nature of the rational is generally to be something unconditioned which for that reason contains its determinateness within itself. In this sense, human beings know about the rational first and foremost insofar as they know of God and know him as determined by himself alone. Following that, a citizen's knowledge of his fatherland and its laws is similarly a knowledge of what is rational, insofar as this counts for him as something unconditioned and at the same time as something universal to which he has to submit his individual will. In the same sense, even the knowledge and volition of a child is already rational, insofar as it knows and embraces the will of its parents.<br/>
Furthermore, the <i>speculative</i> is nothing else than the rational (the positively rational, that is) insofar as it is <i>thought</i>. In ordinary life, the expression <i>speculation</i> tends to be used in a very vague and at the same time subordinate sense, as, for instance, when one speaks of speculations concerning marriage or commerce. What is understood by such 'speculation', then, is merely the fact that, on the one hand, one should go beyond what is immediately on hand and, on the other, what forms the content of such speculations is initially merely something subjective but should not remain so but instead be realized or translated into objectivity.<br/>
What was remarked earlier about the idea holds likewise for this ordinary use of language concerning speculation, to which may be added the further remark that those who count themselves among the more educated also often speak of speculation as something <i>merely</i> subjective. They say, namely, that a certain construal of natural or spiritual conditions and circumstances may be very well and good when taken in a merely speculative manner, but that experience does not agree with it and nothing like it can be countenanced in actuality. Against this position it must be said that, as far as its true meaning is concerned, the speculative is neither provisionally nor even definitively something merely subjective. Instead, it is explicitly what contains those oppositions at which the understanding stops short (thus including the opposition of the subjective and the objective) and contains them as something sublated within itself and precisely by this means proves itself to be concrete and a totality. For this reason, a speculative content can also not be expressed in a one-sided sentence. If we say, for instance, 'the absolute is the unity of the subjective and the objective', this is, to be sure, correct but one-sided insofar as only the <i>unity</i> is expressed here and emphasis is placed on it alone, whereas in fact the subjective and the objective are indeed not only identical but also distinct.<br/>
As regards the significance of the speculative, it bears mentioning here that the same thing is to be understood by it as formerly used to be called the <i>mystical</i>, especially when referring to religious consciousness and its content. When one speaks of the mystical today, it is normally taken to be synonymous with the mysterious and the incomprehensible, and the mysterious and incomprehensible are then – depending on the respective educational background and mindset – regarded by some as something genuine and true, but by others as belonging to superstition and deception. In this regard, it should be noted first that the mystical is indeed something mysterious, but only for the understanding, simply because abstract identity is the principle of the understanding, whereas the mystical (taken as synonymous with the speculative) is the concrete unity of those determinations that count as true for the understanding only in their separation and opposition. So when those who recognize the mystical as the true are likewise happy to call it the absolutely mysterious and leave it at that, they express that, as far as they are concerned, thinking likewise has the significance solely of positing abstract identities, and that in order to attain to the truth one must renounce thinking or, as also tends to be said, that one must take reason captive. But as we have seen, the abstract thinking of the understanding is so far from being something firm and ultimate that, to the contrary, it turns out to be constantly sublating itself and changing over into its opposite, whereas the rational as such consists precisely in containing the opposites as ideal moments within itself. Thus, everything rational is to be called at the same time 'mystical', by which, however, nothing more or less is said than that it goes beyond the understanding and in no way that it is to be regarded generally as inaccessible to thinking and as incomprehensible.</div> <h6 id="s83">§83</h6> <div>The Logic falls into three parts: </div> <div class="remark">1. The doctrine of being.</div> <div class="remark">2. The doctrine of essence.</div> <div class="remark">3. The doctrine of the concept and the idea.<br/>
That is, into the doctrine of thought </div> <div class="remark">1. In its <i>immediacy</i> – the concept-in-itself,</div> <div class="remark">2. In its <i>reflection</i> and <i>mediation –</i> the <i>being-for-itself</i> and the <i>shining</i> [<i>Schein</i>] of the concept.</div> <div class="remark">3. In its <i>having returned back into itself</i> and in its developed being-with-itself – the concept <i>in-and-for-itself</i>.</div> <div class="addtion"> <i>Addition</i>. The division of the Logic here given, as well as the entire discussion of thinking up to this point, is to be regarded as a mere anticipation, and the justification or proof of it can only result from the completed treatment of thinking itself. For in philosophy, demonstrating [<i>beweisen</i>] is equivalent to showing how the object makes itself – through and out of itself – into what it is. – The relationship in which the above-mentioned three major stages of thought or of the logical idea stand to each other is generally to be construed in such a way that only the <i>concept</i> is what is true [<i>das Wahre</i>] and, more precisely, the truth of <i>being</i> and of <i>essence</i>, both of which, held fast for themselves in their isolation, are to be regarded at the same time as untrue: <i>being</i> because it is at first only what is <i>immediate</i>, and <i>essence</i> because it is at first only what is <i>mediated</i>. One might raise the question, then, why, if this is so, we begin with the untrue and not right away with the true. The answer to this is that the truth has to <i>prove</i> [<i>bewähren</i>] itself precisely to be the truth, and here, within the logical sphere, the proof consists in the concept demonstrating itself to be mediated through and with itself and thereby also as what is truly immediate. The aforementioned relationship of the three stages of the logical idea displays its concrete and real shape in the way that we know God (who is the truth) in his truth, i.e. as absolute spirit, only insofar as we recognize at the same time that the world created by him, i.e. nature and finite spirit, are, in their difference from God, untrue.</div> <div id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ12423"><a href="part0016.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ15228">13</a> Translators' note: Goethe, <i>Faust</i>, Part One, tr.

In the Christian world, it will not be admitted that the Chinese and Indian idols, etc. are God, nor will it be admitted regarding the African fetishes or even the Greek gods that such idols are God. Whoever believes in them thus does not believe in God. If, by contrast, it is considered that inherent in such belief in idols is nonetheless <i>as such</i> [<i>an sich</i>] a belief in God <i>in general</i> (just as the genus is in the particular individual), then the veneration of idols also counts as a belief, not only in an idol, but in God. Conversely, the Athenians treated as atheists the poets and philosophers who took Zeus, etc. to be just clouds, etc. and who maintained the existence of a God <i>in general</i> only. – It does not depend on what is contained in an object <i>as such</i> [<i>an sich</i>], but what has been <i>extracted</i> from this for consciousness. If one lets the confusion of these determinations stand, any human intuition, even the most ordinary sensory one, would be religion. For, to be sure, in any such intuition, in every spiritual phenomenon [<i>in jedem Geistigem</i>] there is contained <i>as such</i> the principle that, if developed and purified, expands into religion. But it is one thing <i>to be capable</i> of religion (and the <i>as such</i> [<i>An sich</i>] above expresses capability and possibility), and another <i>to have</i> religion. – Thus in recent times travellers (such as Captains <i>Ross</i> [Sir John Ross, 1777–1856, <i>A Voyage of Discovery…for the Purpose of Exploring Baffin's Bay</i>] and <i>Parry</i> [Sir William Edward Parry, 1790–1855]) have found peoples (e.g. the Eskimos) who in their judgment had no religion, not even the sort of religion one might still find in the African <i>magicians</i> (the <i>goëtes</i> of Herodotus). To mention an entirely different aspect, an Englishman who passed the first months of the last jubilee year in Rome says in his travel reports about today's <i>Romans</i> that the ordinary people are bigoted, but that those who know how to read and write are one and all atheists. – Incidentally, the accusation of atheism has become rarer in recent times, primarily, it would seem, because the basic content and requirements of religion have been reduced to a minimum (see § 73).</div> <div id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ14843"><a href="part0016.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ10558">18</a> Descartes, <i>Principia philosophiae</i> I, 15: 'Magis hoc (ens summe perfectum existere) <i>credet</i>, si attendat, nullius alterius rei ideam apud se inveniri, in qua eodem modo necessariam existentiam contineri animadvertat; intelliget, illam ideam exhibere veram et immutabilem naturam, quaeque <i>non potest non existere</i>, cum necessaria existentia <i>in ea contineatur</i>.' [He will be all the more convinced (namely, that a most perfect being exists), when he notices that necessary existence is contained in no other of his ideas in the same manner; for he will recognize that this idea only represents a true and unchangeable nature that must exist, because necessary existence <i>is contained in it</i>. – tr. A. Buchenau.] A subsequent phrase that sounds like a mediation or proof does not detract from this first foundation. – With Spinoza, it is quite the same, namely, that God's <i>essence</i>, i.e. the abstract representation, includes his existence. The first definition by Spinoza is that of <i>causa sui</i>, namely, that it is such a thing '<i>cuius essentia</i> involvit existentiam; sive id, cuius <i>natura non potest concipi</i>, nisi existens' [whose essence includes existence, or that whose nature cannot conceived except as existing, <i>Ethics</i> I, def. 1, tr. (into German) C. Gebhardt]; – the inseparability of the concept from being is the fundamental determination and the presupposition. But which concept is it to which this inseparability from being pertains? Not that of <i>finite things</i>, for these are precisely those whose existence is a <i>contingent</i> and created one. – That for Spinoza the eleventh proposition (according to which God exists necessarily) is followed by a proof and, similarly, the twentieth that God's existence and his essence are one and the same, this is a superfluous formalism of giving proofs. God is substance, and the only one at that; substance, however, is <i>causa sui, therefore</i> God exists necessarily – this means nothing but that God is that whose concept and being are inseparable.</div> <div id="cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ9621"><a href="part0016.html#cpEyO-AIQeq-q9i3bzoHpQ11173">19</a> By contrast, <i>Anselm</i> says: '<i>Negligentia mihi videtur</i>, si postquam confirmati sumus in fide, non <i>studemus</i>, quod <i>credimus, intelligere</i>' (<i>Tractat.
