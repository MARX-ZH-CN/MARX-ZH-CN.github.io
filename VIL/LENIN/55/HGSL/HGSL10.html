<h2 id="HGL101">Section Two: Objectivity</h2>
<a name="HL3_705"></a>

In Book One of the Objective Logic, abstract <i>being </i>was exhibited as passing over into <i>determinate being, </i>but equally as withdrawing into essence. In Book Two, essence reveals itself as determining itself into ground, thereby entering into <i>Existence </i>and realising itself as <i>substance, </i>but again withdrawing into the <i>Notion. </i>Of the Notion, now, we have shown to begin with that it determines itself into <i>objectivity. </i>It is self-evident that this latter transition is identical in character with what formerly appeared in <i>metaphysics</i> as the <i>inference </i>from the notion, namely, the <i>notion of God, to his existence, </i>or as the so-called <i>ontological proof </i>of the <i>existence of God. </i>It is equally well known that Descartes' sublimest thought, that God is that <i>whose notion includes within itself its being, </i>after being degraded into the defective form of the formal syllogism, that is, into the form of the said proof, finally succumbed to the <i>Critique of Reason </i>and to the thought that <i>existence cannot be extracted from the notion. </i>Some points connected with this proof have already been elucidated. In Vol. 1, pp. 86 sqq., where <i>being </i>has vanished in its immediate opposite, <i>non-being</i>, and <i>becoming</i> has shown itself as the truth of both, attention was drawn to the confusion that arises when, in the case of a particular determinate being, what is fixed on is not the <i>being </i>of that determinate being but its <i>determinate content; </i>then, comparing <i>this determinate content, </i>for example a hundred dollars, with another <i>determinate content, </i>for example, with the context of my perception or the state of my finances, it is found that it makes a difference whether the former content is added to the latter or not – and it is imagined that what has been discussed is the difference between being and non-being, or even the difference between being and the Notion. Further, in the same Vol., p. 112 and Vol. II, p. 442 we elucidated a determination that occurs in the ontological proof, that of <i>a sum-total of all realities. </i>But the essential subject matter of that proof, <i>the connection of the Notion and determinate being, </i>is the concern of our consideration of the <i>Notion </i>just concluded, and the entire course through which the Notion determines itself into <i>objectivity. </i>The Notion, as absolutely self-identical negativity, is self-determining; we have remarked that the Notion, in determining itself into <i>judgment </i>in individuality, is already positing itself as something real, something that <i>is; </i>this still abstract reality completes itself in <i>objectivity.</i><br/><a name="HL3_706"></a>

Now though it might seem that the transition from the Notion into objectivity is not the same thing as the transition from the Notion of God to his existence, it should be borne in mind on the one hand that the determinate <i>content, </i>God, makes no difference in the logical process, and the ontological proof is merely an application of this logical process to the said content. On the other hand however it is essential to bear in mind the remark made above that the subject only obtains determinateness and content in its predicate; until then, no matter what it may be for feeling, intuition and pictorial thinking, for rational cognition it is only a <i>name; </i>but in the predicate with its determinateness there begins, at the same time, <i>realisation </i>in general. The predicates, however, must be grasped as themselves still included within the Notion, hence as something subjective, which so far has not emerged into existence; to this extent we must admit on the one hand that <i>the realisation </i>of the Notion in the judgment is still not complete. On the other hand however the mere determination of an object by predicates, when that determination is not at the same time the realisation and objectifying of the Notion, also remains something so subjective that it is not even the genuine cognition and <i>determination of the Notion </i>of the object-subjective in the sense of abstract reflection and uncomprehended pictorial thinking. God, as the living God, and still more as absolute spirit, is known only in his <i>activity; </i>man was early instructed to recognise God in his <i>works; </i>only from these can proceed the <i>determinations, </i>which are called his properties, and in which, too, his <i>being </i>is contained. Thus the philosophical [<i>begreifende</i>] cognition of his <i>activity,</i> that is, of himself, grasps the <i>Notion </i>of God in his <i>being </i>and his being in his Notion. <i>Being </i>merely as such, or even <i>determinate being, </i>is such a meagre and restricted determination, that the difficulty of finding it in the Notion may well be the result of not having considered what being or determinate being itself is. <i>Being</i> as the wholly <i>abstract, immediate relation to self, </i>is nothing else than the abstract moment of the Notion, which moment is abstract universality. This universality also effects what one demands of being, namely, to be <i>outside </i>the Notion; for though this universality is moment of the Notion, it is equally the difference, or abstract judgment, of the Notion in which it opposes itself to itself.<br/>

The Notion, even as formal, already immediately contains <i>being</i> in a <i>truer and richer </i>form, in that, as self-related negativity, it is <i>individuality.</i><br/><a name="HL3_707"></a>

But of course the difficulty of finding <i>being </i>in the Notion as such and equally in the Notion of God, becomes insuperable when the being is supposed to be that which obtains <i>in the context of outer experience or in the form of sensuous perception, like the hundred dollars in my finances, </i>something to be grasped with the hand, not with the mind, something visible essentially to the outer, not to the inner eye; in other words, when that being which things possess as sensuous, temporal and perishable, is given the name of reality or truth. A philosophising that in its view of being does not rise above sense, naturally stops short at merely abstract thought, too, in its view of the Notion; such thought stands opposed to being.<br/><a name="1533"></a>

The custom of regarding the Notion merely as something one-sided, such as abstract thought is, will already hinder the acceptance of what was suggested above, namely, to regard the transition from the <i>Notion of God </i>to his <i>being, </i>as an <i>application </i>of the logical course of objectification of the Notion presented above. Yet if it is granted, as it commonly is, that the logical element as the formal element constitutes the form for the cognition of every determinate content, then the above relation must at least be conceded, unless in this opposition between Notion and objectivity, one stops short at the untrue Notion and an equally untrue reality, as something ultimate. But in the exposition <i>of the pure Notion, </i>it was further made clear that this is the absolute, divine Notion itself, so that in truth the relationship of our <i>application </i>would not obtain, and the logical process in question would in fact be the immediate exposition of God's self-determination to being. But on this point it is to be remarked that if the Notion is to be presented as the Notion of God, it is to be apprehended as it is when taken up into the <i>Idea. </i>This pure Notion passes through the finite forms of the judgment and syllogism because it is not yet posited as in its own nature explicitly one with objectivity but is grasped only in process of becoming it. Similarly this objectivity, too, is not yet the divine existence, is not yet the reality that is reflected in the divine Idea. Yet objectivity is just that much richer and higher than the <i>being or existence </i>of the ontological proof, as the pure Notion is richer and higher than that metaphysical void of the <i>sum total of all reality. </i>But I reserve for another occasion the more detailed elucidation of the manifold misunderstanding that has been brought by logical formalism into the ontological, as well as the other, so-called proofs of God's existence, as also the Kantian criticism of them, and by establishing their true significance, to restore the fundamental thoughts of these proofs to their worth and dignity.<br/><a name="HL3_708"></a>

As previously remarked, we have already met with several forms of immediacy, though in different determinations. In the sphere of being immediacy is being itself and determinate being; in the sphere of essence it is existence, and then actuality and substantiality; in the sphere of the Notion, besides immediacy as abstract universality, there is now objectivity. When the exactitude of philosophical distinctions of the Notion is not involved, these expressions may be used as synonymous; but the determinations mentioned have issued from the necessity of the Notion. <i>Being</i> is in general the first immediacy, and <i>determinate being </i>is the same <i>plus </i>the first determinateness. <i>Existence, </i>along with things, is the immediacy that issues from the ground-from the self-sublating mediation of the simple reflection of essence. But <i>actuality </i>and <i>substantiality </i>is the immediacy that has issued from the sublated difference of the still unessential Existence as Appearance and its essentiality. Finally, <i>objectivity </i>is the immediacy to which the Notion determines itself by the sublation of its abstraction and mediation. Philosophy has the right to select from the language of common life which is made for the world of pictorial thinking, such expressions as <i>seem to approximate </i>to the determinations of the Notion. There cannot be any question of <i>demonstrating </i>for a word selected from the language of common life that in common life, too, one associates with it the same Notion for which philosophy employs it; for common life has no Notions, but only pictorial thoughts and general ideas, and to recognise the Notion in what is else a mere general idea is philosophy itself. It must suffice therefore if pictorial thinking, in the use of its expressions that are employed for philosophical determinations, has before it some vague idea of their distinctive meaning; just as it may be the case that in these expressions one recognises nuances of pictorial thought that are more closely related to the corresponding Notions. One will be less ready, perhaps, to admit that something can be <i>without existing; </i>but at least, one will hardly use '<i>being</i>' as copula of the judgment as interchangeable with the expression '<i>to exist</i>' and say, 'this article <i>exists </i>dear, suitable, etc.', 'gold <i>exists, </i>a metal or metallic', instead of 'this article <i>is </i>dear, suitable, etc.', 'gold <i>is </i>a metal or metallic'.<br/><a name="HL3_709"></a>

And surely it is usual to distinguish between <i>being</i> and <i>appearing, appearance</i> and <i>actuality</i>, as well as to distinguish mere <i>being</i> from <i>actuality, </i>and still more all these expressions from <i>objectivity. </i>However, even should they be employed synonymously, philosophy will in any case be free to utilise such empty superfluity of language for its distinctions.<br/><a name="1536"></a>

When treating of the apodeictic judgment — the consummation of the judgment — where the subject loses its determinateness as against the predicate, we referred to the twofold meaning of <i>subjectivity </i>originating therefrom, namely, the subjectivity of the Notion, and equally of the externality and contingency opposed to the Notion. A similar twofold meaning also appears for objectivity which stands <i>opposed </i>to the self-subsistent Notion, yet is also the <i>being that is in-and-for-itself. </i>In the former sense, the object stands opposed to the <i>I </i>= <i>I</i> which in subjective idealism is enunciated as the absolutely true; in that case it is the manifold world in its immediate existence with which the ego or the Notion only engages in never-ending struggle, in order, by the negation of the <i>intrinsic nullity </i>of this other, to give to the first certainty of self the <i>actual truth </i>of its equality with itself. In a less specific sense it denotes an object in general for any interest or activity of the subject.<br/><a name="1537"></a>

But in the opposite sense, objectivity signifies that which is <i>in and for itself, </i>and free from limitation and opposition. Rational principles, perfect works of art, etc., are called <i>objective </i>in so far as they are free and above all contingency. Although rational, theoretical or ethical principles belong only to subjectivity, to consciousness, yet that element in the latter that is in and for itself is called objective; the cognition of truth is placed in cognising the object as object, free from anything added by subjective reflection, and right conduct in the obedience to objective laws that are not subjective in origin and admit no caprice and no treatment that might overthrow their necessity.<br/><a name="HL3_710"></a>

At the present standpoint of our exposition objectivity signifies, in the first instance, <i>the absolute being of the Notion, </i>that is, the Notion that has sublated the <i>mediation </i>posited in its self-determination and converted it into <i>immediate </i>relation-to-self. Consequently this immediacy is itself immediately and wholly pervaded by the Notion, just as the Notion's totality is immediately identical with its being. But since, further, the Notion has equally to restore the free being-for-self of its subjectivity, there arises a relationship between the Notion as <i>end </i>and objectivity. In this relationship the immediacy of the objectivity becomes the negative element over against the end, an element to be determined by the activity of the end; this immediacy thus acquires the other significance, that of being in and for itself null in so far as it stands opposed to the Notion.<br/><a name="1539"></a>

First, then, objectivity is an immediacy whose moments, by virtue of the totality of all the moments, exist in a self-subsistent indifference as <i>objects outside one another, </i>and in their relationship possess the <i>subjective unity </i>of the Notion only as an <i>inner </i>or an outer unity. This is <i>Mechanism</i>.<br/><a name="1540"></a>

But secondly, this unity reveals itself as the immanent law of the objects themselves, and thus their relationship becomes their <i>peculiar </i>specific difference founded on their law; it becomes a relation in which their determinate self-subsistence sublates itself. This is <i>Chemism</i>.<br/><a name="1541"></a>

Thirdly, this essential unity of the objects is thereby posited as distinct from their self-subsistence; it is the subjective Notion, but posited as in and for itself related to objectivity, as <i>end. </i>This is <i>Teleology</i>.<br/><a name="1542"></a>

Since the end is the Notion that is posited as in its own self relating itself to objectivity and as sublating by its own act its defect of being subjective, the purposiveness which is at first <i>external </i>becomes, through the realisation of the end, <i>internal</i> and the <i>Idea</i>.<br/>
<a name="HL3_711"></a>
<h3 id="HGL102">Chapter 1 Mechanism</h3>

As objectivity is the totality of the Notion withdrawn into its unity, an immediate is thereby posited that is in and for itself this totality, and is also <i>posited </i>as such, although in it the negative unity of the Notion has not as yet detached itself from the immediacy of this totality; in other words, objectivity is not yet posited <i>as judgment. </i>In so far as it has the Notion immanent in it, it contains the difference of the Notion, but on account of the objective totality, the differentiated moments are <i>complete and self-subsistent objects </i>which consequently, even in their relation, stand to one another only as <i>self-subsistent </i>things and remain <i>external </i>to one another in every combination. This is what constitutes the character of <i>mechanism, </i>namely, that whatever relation obtains between the things combined, this relation is one <i>extraneous</i> to them that does not concern their nature at all, and even if it is accompanied by a semblance of unity it remains nothing more <i>than composition, mixture, aggregation </i>and the like. <i>Spiritual</i> mechanism also, like <i>material, </i>consists in this, that the things related in the spirit remain external to one another and to spirit itself. A <i>mechanical style of thinking, a mechanical memory, habit, a mechanical way of acting, </i>signify that the peculiar pervasion and presence of spirit is lacking in what spirit apprehends or does. Although its theoretical or practical mechanism cannot take place without its self-activity, without an impulse and consciousness, yet there is lacking in it the freedom of individuality, and because this freedom is not manifest in it such action appears as a merely external one.<br/>
<a name="HL3_711a"></a><a name="1544"></a>
<h4 id="HGL103">A. The Mechanical Object</h4>

The object is, as we have seen, the <i>syllogism, </i>whose mediation has been sublated [<i>ausgeglichen</i>] and has therefore become an immediate identity. It is therefore in and for itself a universal — universality not in the sense of a community of properties, but a universality that pervades the particularity and in it is immediate individuality.<br/><a name="1545"></a>

1. In the first place therefore the object does not differentiate itself into <i>matter and </i>form — a matter as the self-subsistent universal side of the object and a form as the particular and individual side; such an abstract difference of individuality and universality is excluded by the Notion of object; if it is regarded as matter it must be taken as in principle formed matter. Similarly, it may be defined as a thing with properties, as a whole consisting of parts, as a substance with accidents, or in terms of other relationships of reflection; but these relationships have been altogether superseded already in the Notion; the object therefore has neither properties nor accidents, for these are separable from the thing or the substance, whereas in the object the particularity is absolutely reflected into the totality. In the parts of a whole, there is indeed present that self-subsistence which belongs to the differences of the object, but these differences are themselves directly and essentially objects, totalities, that are not, like parts, determined as such in contrast to the whole.<br/><a name="1546"></a>

The object is therefore in the first instance <i>indeterminate, </i>in so far as it has no determinate opposition in it; for it is the mediation that has collapsed into immediate identity. In so far as the <i>Notion is essentially determinate, </i>the object possesses determinateness as a <i>manifoldness </i>which though complete is otherwise <i>indeterminate, </i>that is, <i>contains no relationships, </i>and which constitutes a totality that at first is similarly no further determined; <i>sides or parts </i>that may be distinguished in it belong to an external reflection. This quite indeterminate difference therefore means only that there are a <i>number </i>of objects, each of which only contains its determinateness reflected into its universality and does not reflect itself <i>outwards. </i>Because this indeterminate determinateness is essential to the object, the latter is within itself a <i>plurality </i>of this kind, and must therefore be regarded as a <i>composite or aggregate. </i>It does not however consist of <i>atoms, </i>for these are not objects because they are not totalities. The Leibnizian monad would be more of an object since it is a total representation of the world, but confined within its <i>intensive subjectivity </i>it is supposed at least to be essentially one within itself. Nevertheless, the monad determined as <i>an exclusive one </i>is only a principle that <i>reflection assumes. </i>Yet the monad is an object, partly in that the ground of its manifold representations — of the developed, that is, the <i>posited </i>determinations of its merely <i>implicit totality lies outside it, </i>and partly also in that it is indifferent to the monad that it constitutes an object <i>along with others; </i>it is thus in fact not <i>exclusive or determined for itself.</i><br/><a name="1547"></a>

2. As the object, then, in its determined being is a totality and yet on account of its indeterminateness and immediacy is not the <i>negative unity </i>of that determined being, it is <i>indifferent </i>to the <i>determinations as individual, </i>as determined in and for themselves, just as these latter are themselves <i>indifferent </i>to one another. These, therefore, are not comprehensible from it nor from one another; its totality is the form of general reflectedness of its manifoldness into individuality in general which is in its own self indeterminate. The determinatenesses, therefore, that it contains, do indeed belong to it, but the <i>form </i>that constitutes their difference and combines them into a unity is an external, indifferent one; whether it be a <i>mixture, </i>or again an <i>order, </i>a certain <i>arrangement </i>of parts and sides, all these are combinations that are indifferent to what is so related.<br/><a name="1548"></a>

Thus the object, like any determinate being in general, has the determinateness of its totality <i>outside</i> it in <i>other </i>objects, and these in turn have theirs <i>outside them, </i>and so on to infinity. The return-into-self of this progression to infinity must indeed likewise be assumed and represented as a <i>totality, a world; </i>but that world is nothing but the universality that is confined within itself by indeterminate individuality, that is, a <i>universe.</i><br/><a name="1549"></a>

The object, therefore, being in its determinateness equally indifferent to it, it is the object's own nature that points it <i>outside and beyond itself </i>to other objects for its determination; but to these others, their <i>determinant function </i>is similarly a <i>matter of indifference.</i> Consequently, a principle of self-determination is nowhere to be found; <i>determinism</i> — the standpoint occupied by cognition when it takes the object, just as we have found it here, to be the truth — assigns for each determination of the object that of another object; but this other is likewise indifferent both to its being determined and to its active determining. For this reason determinism itself is also indeterminate in the sense that it involves the progression to infinity; it can halt and be satisfied at any point at will, because the object it has reached in its progress, being a formal totality, is shut up within itself and indifferent to its being determined by another. Consequently, the <i>explanation </i>of the determination of an object and the progressive determining of the object made for the purpose of the explanation, is only an <i>empty word, </i>since in the other object to which it advances there resides no self-determination.<br/><a name="1550"></a>

3. Now as the determinateness of an object <i>lies in an other, </i>no determinate difference is to be found between them; the determinateness is merely <i>doubled, </i>once in one object and again in the other, something utterly <i>identical, </i>so that the explanation or comprehension is <i>tautological. </i>This tautology is an external futile see-saw; since the determinateness obtains from the objects which are indifferent to it no peculiar distinctiveness and is therefore only identical, there is before us only one determinateness; and its being doubled expresses just this externality and nullity of a difference. But at the same time the objects are <i>self-subsistent </i>in regard to one another; therefore in the identity above-mentioned they remain absolutely <i>external </i>to one another. Here, then, we have the manifest <i>contradiction </i>between the complete mutual <i>indifference </i>of the objects and the <i>identity </i>of their <i>determinateness,</i> or the contradiction of their complete <i>externality </i>in the <i>identity</i> of their determinateness. This contradiction is, therefore, the <i>negative unity </i>of a number of objects which, in that unity, simply repel one another: this is the <i>mechanical process.</i><br/><a name="HL3_714"></a><a name="1551"></a>
<h4 id="HGL104">B. The Mechanical Process</h4>

If objects are regarded merely as self-enclosed totalities, they cannot act on one another. In this determination they are the same thing as the <i>monads, </i>which for this very reason were thought of as exercising no influence whatever on one another. But the concept of a monad is, just for this reason, a defective reflection. For first it is a <i>determinate </i>conception of the monad's merely <i>implicit</i> totality; as a <i>certain degree </i>of the development and <i>positedness of</i> its representation of the world, it is <i>determinate; </i>now while it is a self-enclosed totality, it is also indifferent to this determinateness; therefore the determinateness is not its own, but one that is <i>posited by another </i>object. Secondly it is an <i>immediate </i>in general, in so far as it is supposed to be merely a <i>mirroring entity; </i>its relation to itself is therefore <i>abstract universality; </i>hence it is a <i>determinate being open to others. </i>To gain the freedom of substance it is not sufficient to represent it as a totality that is <i>complete within itself </i>and has nothing to receive <i>from without. </i>On the contrary, the mechanical [<i>begrifflose</i>], merely mirrored relation to itself is precisely a <i>passivity </i>towards another. Similarly <i>determinateness,</i> whether taken as the determinateness of something that <i>is </i>or of a <i>mirroring </i>entity, that is a <i>degree </i>of the monad's own spontaneous development, is something <i>external; </i>the degree that the development reaches has its <i>limit </i>in an other. To shift the reciprocity of substances on to a <i>predetermined harmony </i>means nothing more than to convert it into a <i>presupposition, </i>that is, to withdraw it from the Notion. The need to avoid the <i>interaction </i>of substances was based on the moment of absolute <i>self-subsistence and originality</i> which was made a fundamental assumption. But since the <i>positedness, </i>the degree of development, does not correspond to this <i>in-itself, </i>it has for that very reason its ground in an other.<br/><a name="1552"></a>

When treating of the relationship of substantiality, we showed that it passes over into the causal relationship. But here what <i>is,</i> no longer has the determination of a <i>substance, </i>but of an object; the causal relationship has been superseded in the Notion; the originality of one substance in relation to the other has shown itself to be illusory, its action to be transition into the opposed substance. This relationship therefore has no objectivity. Hence in so far as the one object is posited in the form of subjective unity as active cause, this no longer counts as an original determination but as something <i>mediated; </i>the active object has this its determination only by means of another object. <i>Mechanism, </i>since it belongs to the sphere of the Notion, has that posited within it which proved to be the truth of the causal relationship, namely that the cause, which is supposed to be the original and self-subsistent factor is essentially effect, positedness, as well. In mechanism therefore the causality of the object is immediately a non-originality; it is indifferent to this its determination, therefore its being cause is for it something contingent. To this extent, one might indeed say that the causality of substances is <i>only a subjective conception. </i>But this causality as thus represented is precisely <i>mechanism</i>; for mechanism is this, that causality as <i>identical </i>determinateness of different substances and hence as the extinction of their self-subsistence in this identity, is a <i>mere positedness; </i>the objects are indifferent to this unity and maintain themselves in face of it. But, no less is this their indifferent <i>self-subsistence </i>also a mere <i>positedness; </i>they are therefore capable of <i>mixing and aggregating </i>and of becoming, as an <i>aggregate, one object. </i>Through this indifference both to their transition and to their self-subsistence, substances are <i>objects</i>.<br/>
<h5 id="HGL105">(a) The Formal Mechanical Process</h5>

The mechanical process is the positing of what is contained in the Notion of mechanism, and therefore, in the first instance, of a <i>contradiction.</i><br/>

1. It follows from the Notion just indicated that the interaction of objects takes the form of the <i>positing </i>of the <i>identical </i>relation of the objects. This consists merely in giving to the determinateness that is determined, the form of <i>universality; </i>this is <i>communication,</i> which does not involve transition into an opposite. <i>Spiritual communication, </i>which moreover takes place in that element which is the universal in the form of universality, is explicitly an <i>ideal</i> relation in which <i>a determinateness continues </i>itself from one person into another unimpaired, and universalises itself without any alteration whatever-as a scent freely spreads in the unresisting atmosphere. But even in communication between material objects, their determinateness <i>spreads, </i>so to speak, in a similarly ideal manner; personality is an infinitely more intense <i>impenetrability</i> [<i>Harte</i>] than objects possess. The formal totality of the object in general, which is indifferent to the determinateness and hence is not a self-determination, makes it undistinguished from the other object and thus renders the interaction primarily an unimpeded continuation of the determinateness of the one in the other.<br/><a name="1554"></a>

Now in the spiritual sphere there is an infinitely manifold content that is communicable; for being taken up into intelligence it receives this <i>form </i>of universality in which it becomes communicable. But the universal that is such not merely through the form but in and for itself, is the <i>objective </i>as such, both in the spiritual and in the material sphere; as against which the individuality of outer objects as well as of persons is an unessential element that can offer it no resistance. Laws, morals, rational conceptions in general, are in the spiritual sphere such communicable entities which penetrate individuals in an unconscious manner and exert their influence on them. In the material sphere the communicable entities are motion, heat, magnetism, electricity and the like-which, even if people insist on representing them as stuffs or matters, must be characterised as <i>imponderable </i>agents — agents lacking that element of materiality which is the foundation <i>of matter's individualised existence.</i><br/><a name="1555"></a>

2. Now if in the interaction of objects their <i>identical </i>universality is first posited, it is equally necessary to posit the other moment of the Notion, <i>particularity; </i>objects accordingly demonstrate also <i>their self-subsistence, </i>maintain themselves as mutually external and establish an <i>individuality </i>in that universality. This establishing is <i>reaction </i>in general. To begin with, reaction is not to be conceived as a <i>mere suspension </i>of the action and of the communicated determinateness; what is communicated is, as a universal, positive in the particular objects and only <i>particularises itself </i>in their diversity. So far, then, what is communicated remains what it is; it merely <i>distributes </i>itself to the objects or is determined by their particularity. The cause gets lost in its other, the effect, the activity of the causal substance in its action; but the <i>active object</i> only becomes a <i>universal; </i>its action is primarily not a loss of its determinateness but a <i>particularisation, </i>whereby the object which at first was the whole of that individual determinateness in it, is now a <i>species </i>of it, and through this the <i>determinateness is</i> posited for the first time as a universal. The two processes, the raising of the individual determinateness into universality. in communication, and the particularisation of it, or the reduction of what was solely a one to a <i>species, </i>in distribution, are one and the same.<br/><a name="1556"></a>
<i>Now reaction </i>is equal to <i>action. </i>The manner in which this first appears, is that the second object <i>has taken up into itself </i>the entire universal, and so is now active against the first. Thus its reaction is the same as the action, a <i>reciprocal repulsion </i>of the <i>impulse. </i>Secondly, what is communicated is the objective element; it therefore <i>remains </i>the substantial determination of the objects along with the presupposition of their diversity; thus the universal specifies itself at the same time in them, and each object therefore does not merely give back the whole action, but has its specific share. But thirdly, reaction is a <i>wholly negative action </i>in so far as each object through the <i>elasticity of its self-subsistence</i> expels the positedness of an other in it and maintains its relation-to-self. The specific particularity of the communicated determinateness in the objects, what was before called a species, returns to <i>individuality, </i>and the object asserts its externality in face of the <i>communicated universality. </i>The action thereby passes over into <i>rest. </i>It shows itself to be a merely <i>superficial, </i>transient alteration in the self-enclosed indifferent totality of the object.<br/><a name="1557"></a>

3. This return constitutes the <i>product </i>of the mechanical process. <i>Immediately, </i>the object is <i>presupposed </i>as an individual; further, it is a particular in relation to others; and again thirdly, as something indifferent to its particularity, as a universal. The <i>product</i> is that <i>presupposed </i>totality of the Notion now <i>posited </i>as a totality. It is the conclusion in which the communicated universal is united with individuality through the particularity of the object; but at the same time in rest the <i>mediation </i>is posited as a mediation that <i>has sublated </i>itself; in other words, it is posited that the product is indifferent to this determining of it, and that the determinateness it has received is an external one in it.<br/><a name="1558"></a>

Accordingly the product is the same as the object that first enters into the process. But at the same time it is through this movement that it is first <i>determined; in general, </i>it is <i>only as a product </i>that the mechanical object is an <i>object; </i>because it is only <i>through the mediation of an other </i>in it that it is what it is. Thus in being a product it is what it is supposed to be in and for itself, a <i>compound or mixture, </i>a certain <i>order and arrangement </i>of parts, in general, something whose determinateness is not a self-determination but one that is <i>posited.</i><br/><a name="1559"></a>

On the other hand, it is no less true that the <i>result </i>of the mechanical process <i>does not already exist before that process; its end </i>is not in <i>its beginning </i>as in the case of the teleological end. The product is a determinateness in the object as an <i>externally </i>posited one. Therefore, as regards its <i>Notion, </i>this product is indeed the same thing as the object already is from the beginning. But in the beginning the external determinateness does not yet appear as <i>posited. </i>To this extent the result is something <i>quite other </i>than the first determinate being of the object for which it is something utterly contingent.<br/><a name="HL3_718"></a>
<h5 id="HGL106">(b) The real mechanical process</h5>

The mechanical process passes over into <i>rest. </i>That is to say the determinateness which the object obtains through the process is only an <i>external </i>one. Equally external to it is this rest itself, since rest is the opposite determinateness to the <i>action </i>of the object, but every determinateness is indifferent to the object; rest can therefore be regarded as produced by an <i>external </i>cause, just as much as it was indifferent to the object to be active.<br/><a name="1561"></a>

Now further, since the determinateness is a <i>posited </i>one and the Notion of the object has <i>returned to itself through mediation, the</i> object contains the determinateness as one that is reflected into itself. Hence in the mechanical process the objects and the process itself have a more precisely determined relationship. They are not merely diverse, but are now <i>specifically distinguished </i>as against one another. The result of the formal process which on the one hand is determinationless rest, is therefore, on the other hand, through the reflection into self of the determinateness, the <i>distribution of the opposition </i>which the object as such contains, among several objects standing in a mechanical relationship to one another. The object that on the one hand lacks all determination whatever and is neither <i>elastic nor self-subsistent </i>in its relationships, has on the other hand a <i>self-subsistence </i>that is <i>impenetrable </i>to other objects. Objects now also have as against one another this more specific opposition of <i>self-subsistent individuality </i>and a <i>universality that lacks self-subsistence. </i>The precise difference may be conceived as a merely <i>quantitative </i>one, as a difference of the magnitude of <i>mass </i>in the bodies, or as a difference of <i>intensity, </i>or in various other ways. But in general the difference is not to be adhered to in that abstraction; as objects, both are also <i>positively </i>self-subsistent.<br/><a name="1562"></a>

Now the first moment of this real <i>process </i>is, as before, <i>communication. The weaker </i>can be seized and penetrated by the <i>stronger</i> only in so far as it accepts the latter and constitutes one <i>sphere</i> with it. just as in the material sphere the weak is secured against the disproportionately strong (as a sheet hanging free in the air is not pierced by a musket ball, or a weak organic receptivity is less susceptible to strong, than to weak, stimuli), so the wholly feeble spirit is safer from the strong spirit than one that stands nearer to the strong. Imagine if you like someone quite dull-witted and ignoble, then on such a person lofty intelligence and nobility can make no impression. The only consistent defence <i>against </i>reason is to have no dealings with it at all. Where the object that is not self-subsistent cannot make contact with one that is and no communication can take place between them, the latter can also offer no <i>resistance, </i>that is, cannot specify the communicated universal for itself. If they were not in the same sphere, their relation to one another would be an infinite judgment, and no process between them would be possible.<br/><a name="1563"></a>
<i>Resistance </i>is the precise moment of the overpowering of the one object by the other, for it is the incipient moment of the distribution of the communicated universal and of the positing of the self-related negativity, of the individuality to be established. Resistance is <i>overcome </i>where the determinateness of the object is <i>inadequate </i>to the communicated universal that has been taken up by the object and is supposed to individualise itself in it. The object's relative lack of self-subsistence manifests itself in the fact that its <i>individuality </i>lacks the <i>capacity </i>for what is <i>communicated </i>and therefore is disrupted by it, because it cannot constitute itself as <i>subject </i>in this universal, or make this latter <i>its predicate. </i>It is only in this second aspect that the <i>violence</i> [<i>Gewalt</i>] exercised on an object is something <i>extraneous </i>to it. What turns <i>power</i> [<i>Macht</i>] <i>into violence </i>is this, that though power, an objective universality, is <i>identical </i>with the <i>nature </i>of the object, its determinateness or negativity is not its own <i>negative reflection</i> into itself by which it is an individual. In so far as the negativity of the object is not reflected into itself in the power, and the power is not the object's own self-relation, it is, as against the power, <i>only abstract </i>negativity whose manifestation is extinction.<br/><a name="1564"></a>

Power, as <i>objective universality </i>and as violence directed <i>against</i> the object, is what is called fate — a conception that falls within mechanism in so far as it is called <i>blind, </i>that is, its <i>objective universality </i>is not recognised by the subject in its specific peculiarity. To make a few observations on this point: the fate of the living being is in general the <i>genus, </i>which manifests itself through the perishableness of the living individuals, which in their <i>actual individuality </i>do not possess the genus as genus. As mere objects, merely animate natures, like all other things of a lower grade, have no fate; what befalls them is a contingency; but <i>in their Notion as objects </i>they are <i>external </i>to themselves; therefore the alien power of fate is nothing else but their <i>own immediate nature,</i> externality and contingency itself. Only self-consciousness has a fate in the proper meaning of the word, because it <i>is free</i>, and therefore in the <i>individuality </i>of its ego possesses a being that is absolutely <i>in and for itself </i>and can oppose itself to its objective universality and <i>estrange </i>itself from it. By this very separation, however, it excites against itself the mechanical relationship of a fate. In order therefore that this fate should be able to have power over it, it must have given itself some determinateness or other conflicting with the essential universality; it must have committed a <i>deed. </i>By this, it has made itself into a <i>particular, </i>and this existence as abstract universality, is at the same time the side open to the communication of its estranged essence; it is on this side that it is drawn into the process. The nation without deeds is without blame; it is wrapped in objective moral universality and dissolved in it and lacks that individuality which, while it moves the unmoved, and gives itself a determinateness outwards and an abstract universality separated from the objective universality, yet in so doing converts the subject into something estranged from its essence, into an <i>object, </i>and brings it into the relationship of <i>externality</i> towards its nature, into that of mechanism.<br/><a name="HL3_721"></a>
<h5 id="HGL107">(c) The Product of the Mechanical Process</h5>

The product of formal mechanism is the object in general, an indifferent totality in which <i>determinateness </i>appears as <i>posited</i>. The object having hereby entered the process as a <i>determinate </i>thing, the extinction of the process results on the one hand in <i>rest, </i>as the original formalism of the object, the negativity of its being determined for itself. But on the other hand the sublating of the determinedness as the <i>positive reflection of it </i>into itself, is the determinateness that has withdrawn into itself or the <i>posited totality of the Notion-the true individuality </i>of the object. The object, determined at first in its indeterminate universality then as a <i>particular, </i>is now determined as <i>objectively an individual, </i>so that in it that mere <i>semblance of individuality </i>which is only a self-subsistence <i>opposing </i>itself to the substantial universality, has been sublated.<br/><a name="1566"></a>

This reflection into self then is, as we have seen, the objective oneness of the objects, a oneness which is an individual self-subsistence — the centre. Secondly, the reflection of negativity is a universality that is not a fate confronting the determinateness, but a fate immanently determined and rational-a universality <i>that particularises itself from within, </i>the difference that is at rest and is constant in the unstable particularity of objects and in their process; in other words, the <i>law. </i>This result is the truth, and therefore also the foundation, of the mechanical process.<br/>
<a name="HL3_722"></a><a name="1567"></a>
<h4 id="HGL108">C. Absolute Mechanism</h4>
<h5 id="HGL109">(a) The Centre</h5>

In the first place then the empty manifoldness of objects is gathered into objective individuality, into the simple self-determining <i>centre. </i>Secondly, in so far as the object as an immediate totality retains its indifference to determinateness, the latter is present in it also as unessential or as a <i>mutual externality </i>of many objects. The prior, the essential determinateness, on the other hand, constitutes the <i>real middle term </i>between the many mechanically interacting bodies, by which they are united <i>in and for themselves,</i> and is their objective universality. Universality exhibited itself at first in the relationship of <i>communication </i>as present only through <i>positing; </i>but as <i>objective </i>universality it is the pervading immanent essence of the objects.<br/><a name="1568"></a>

In the material world it is the <i>central body </i>that is the <i>genus, </i>but it is the <i>individual </i>universality of the single objects and their mechanical process. The relationship in which the unessential single bodies stand to one another is one of mutual <i>thrust </i>and <i>pressure; </i>this kind of relationship does not hold between the central body and the objects whose essence it is, for their externality no longer constitutes their basic determination. Their identity with the central body is, therefore, rather rest, namely, the <i>being in their centre; </i>this unity is their absolute Notion. It remains, however, merely an <i>ought-to-be, </i>since the externality of the objects which is still also posited does not correspond to that unity. Their consequent <i>striving </i>towards the centre is their absolute universality, not a universality posited by <i>communication; </i>it constitutes the true <i>rest </i>that is itself <i>concrete and not posited from outside, </i>into which the process of the non-self-subsistent bodies must return. That is why it is an empty abstraction to assume in mechanics that a body set in motion would continue to move in a straight line to infinity if external resistance did not rob it of its motion. <i>Friction</i>, or whatever other form resistance takes, is only the manifestation of <i>centrality; </i>for it is centrality that in an absolute manner brings the body back to itself; for the thing in contact with which the moving body meets friction has the power of resistance solely through its union with the centre. In the <i>spiritual </i>sphere the centre and unity with the centre assume higher forms; but the unity of the Notion and its reality which here, to begin with, is mechanical centrality, must there too constitute the basic determination.<br/><a name="HL3_723"></a>

Thus the central body has ceased to be a mere <i>object, </i>for in the latter the determinateness is an unessential element; for the central body no longer possesses the objective totality only <i>implicitly </i>but also <i>explicitly. </i>It can therefore be regarded as an <i>individual</i>. Its determinateness is essentially different from a mere order or <i>arrangement and external connection </i>of parts; as determinateness in and for itself it is an <i>immanent </i>form, a self-determining principle in which the objects inhere and by which they are bound together into a genuine One.<br/><a name="1570"></a>

But this central individual is thus at first only a <i>middle term</i> which as yet has no true extremes; but as negative unity of the total Notion it sunders itself into such. Or in other words the previously non-self-subsistent, self-external objects are likewise by the regress of the Notion determined into individuals; the identity of the central body with itself which is still a <i>striving</i>, is infected with <i>externality </i>which, being taken up into the centra body's <i>objective individuality, </i>has this latter determination communicated to it. Through this centrality of their own, these individuals placed outside that first centre, are themselves centres for the non-self-subsistent objects. These second centres and the non-self-subsistent objects are brought into unity by the above absolute middle term.<br/><a name="1571"></a>

But the relative individual centres themselves also constitute the middle term of a <i>second syllogism, </i>a middle term that on the one hand is subsumed under a higher extreme, namely the objective <i>universality</i> and <i>power</i> of the absolute centre, and on the other hand subsumes under itself the non-self-subsistent objects whose superficial or formal individualisation is supported by it. Again, these non-self-subsistent objects are the middle term of a <i>third</i>, the <i>formal syllogism, </i>in that they are the link between the absolute and the relative central individuality to the extent that the latter has in them its externality by virtue of which the <i>relation-to-self </i>is at the same time <i>a striving </i>towards an absolute centre. The formal objects have for their essence the identical <i>gravity </i>of their immediate central body in which they inhere as in their subject and the extreme of individuality; through the externality which they constitute, that body is subsumed under the absolute central body; they are, therefore, the formal middle term of <i>particularity. </i>But the absolute individual is the objectively universal middle term which brings into unity and holds fast the being-within-self or inwardness of the relative individual and its externality. Similarly, too, the <i>government</i>, the <i>individual citizens</i> and the <i>needs</i> or <i>external life</i> of the individuals, are three terms, each of which is the middle of the other two. The <i>government</i> is the absolute centre in which the extreme of the individuals is united with their external existence; similarly, the <i>individuals</i> are the middle term that activate that universal individual into external concrete existence and translate their moral essence into the extreme of actuality. The third syllogism is the formal syllogism, that of an illusory show, in which the individuals purport to be linked to this universal absolute individuality by their <i>needs </i>and external existence; a syllogism which, as merely subjective, passes over into the others and in them has its truth.<br/><a name="1572"></a>

This totality, whose moments are themselves the complete relationships of the Notion, the <i>syllogisms </i>in which each of the three different objects runs through the determination of middle term and of extremes, constitutes free <i>mechanism. </i>In it the different objects have for their basic determination the objective universality, the <i>pervasive </i>gravity that maintains its <i>identity </i>in the <i>particularisation. </i>The relations of <i>pressure, thrust, attraction and</i> the like, as also <i>aggregations or mixtures, </i>belong to the relationship of externality which forms the basis of the third of this group of syllogisms. Order, which is the merely external determinateness of objects, has passed over into the determination that is immanent and objective; this is <i><strong>Law</strong>.</i><br/>
<a name="HL3_724"></a>
<h5 id="HGL1010">(b) Law</h5>

In law, the more specific difference between the <i>ideal reality</i> of objectivity and its <i>external reality </i>is made prominent. The object, as <i>immediate </i>totality of the Notion, does not yet possess externality as distinct from the <i>Notion </i>which is not yet posited for itself. The object, being withdrawn into itself through the process, there has arisen the opposition of <i>simple centrality </i>against an <i>externality</i> which is now determined as externality, that is, is <i>posited </i>as that which is not <i>in and for itself. </i>That identical or ideal aspect of individuality is, on account of the relation to externality, an <i>ought-to-be; </i>it is that unity of the Notion, absolutely determined and self-determining, to which that external reality does not correspond, and therefore gets no further than a <i>striving </i>towards it. But individuality is <i>in and for itself the concrete principle of negative unity, and as such itself totality, </i>a unity that sunders itself into the <i>specific differences of the Notion </i>and abides within its self-identical universality; it is thus the centre <i>expanded </i>within its pure ideality <i>by difference.</i><br/>
<a name="HL3_725"></a>
This reality which corresponds to the Notion is the <i>ideal </i>reality that is distinct from the reality that was merely a <i>striving; </i>it is the difference, not as in the first instance a plurality of objects, but difference in its essential nature and taken up into pure universality. This real ideality is the <i>soul </i>of the previously developed objective totality, <i>the absolutely determined identity </i>of the system.<br/><a name="1575"></a>

The objective <i>being-in-and-for-self </i>appears therefore more specifically in its totality as the negative unity of the centre, which divides itself into <i>subjective individuality</i> and <i>external objectivity,</i> maintains the former in the latter and determines it in an ideal difference. This self-determining unity that absolutely reduces external objectivity to ideality is the principle of <i>self-movement</i> the <i>determinateness </i>of this animating principle, which is the difference of the Notion itself, is law. Dead mechanism was the mechanical process considered above of objects that appeared immediately as self-subsistent but which for that very reason are, in truth, not self-subsistent and have their centre outside themselves; this process, which passes over into rest, exhibits either <i>contingency </i>and indeterminate dissimilarity or <i>formal uniformity. </i>This uniformity is indeed a rule, but not a <i>law. </i>Only free mechanism has a <i>law, </i>the spontaneous determination of pure individuality or <i>of the explicated Notion; </i>as difference, it is in its own self the imperishable source of self-kindling movement, and since in the ideality of its difference it relates itself to itself alone, it is <i>free necessity.</i><br/>
<a name="HL3_725a"></a>
<h5 id="HGL1011">(c) Transition of Mechanism</h5>

This soul, however, is still submerged in its body: the Notion of the objective totality, <i>determinate now </i>but <i>inner, </i>is free necessity — the law has not yet confronted its object; it is the <i>concrete </i>centrality as universality <i>immediately </i>expanded into its objectivity. This ideality, therefore, has not the <i>objects themselves </i>for its determinate difference; these are <i>self-subsistent individuals </i>of the totality, or also, if we look back to the formal stage, non-individual, external <i>objects. </i>Law is indeed immanent in them and constitutes their nature and power; but its difference is confined within its ideality, and the objects are not themselves differentiated into the ideal difference of the law. But it is solely in the ideal centrality and its laws that the object possesses its essential self-subsistence; it is therefore powerless to resist the judgment of the Notion and to maintain itself in abstract, indeterminate self-subsistence and aloofness.<br/>
<a name="HL3_726"></a>

By virtue of the ideal difference immanent in it, its existence is a <i>determinateness posited by the Notion. </i>Its lack of self-subsistence is in this way no longer merely a <i>striving </i>towards the <i>centre, </i>as against which, just because its relation to it is only a striving, it still has the appearance of a self-subsistent external object; on the contrary, it is a striving towards the <i>object specifically opposed to it; </i>and similarly the centre itself has in consequence fallen asunder and its negative unity passed has over into <i>objectified opposition. </i>Centrality is, therefore, now a <i>relation </i>of these reciprocally negative objectivities in a state of mutual tension. Thus free mechanism determines itself into <i>chemism</i>.<br/>
<a name="HL3_727"></a>
<h3 id="HGL1012">Chapter 2 Chemism</h3>
<p>
Chemism constitutes in objectivity as a whole, the moment of judgment, of the difference that has become objective, and of the process. Since it already begins with determinateness and positedness and the chemical object is at the same time an objective totality, its immediate course is simple and is completely determined by its presupposition.<br/>
<a name="HL3_727a"></a><a name="1579"></a>
<h4 id="HGL1013">A. THE CHEMICAL OBJECT</h4>

The chemical object is distinguished from the mechanical by the fact that the latter is a totality indifferent to determinateness, whereas in the case of the chemical object the <i>determinateness</i>, and consequently the <i>relation to other </i>and the kind and manner of this relation, belong to its nature. This determinateness is at the same time essentially a <i>particularisation, </i>that is, it is taken up into universality; thus it is a <i>principle — universal determinateness</i>, the determinateness not only of the <i>one individual object </i>but also of <i>the other. </i>In the chemical object, therefore, we now have the distinction between its Notion as the inner totality of the two determinatenesses, and the determinateness that constitutes the nature of the individual object in its <i>externality and concrete existence. </i>Since in this way it is <i>in itself or implicitly </i>the whole Notion, it has in its own self the <i>necessity </i>and the <i>urge </i>to sublate its opposed, <i>one sided — existence </i>and to give itself an existence as that <i>real whole </i>that according to its Notion it is.<br/><a name="1580"></a>

With regard to the expression <i>chemism </i>for the relation of the difference of objectivity as it has presented itself, it may be further remarked that the expression must not be understood here as though this relation only exhibited itself in that form of elemental nature to which the name chemism so called is strictly applied. Even the meteorological relation must be regarded as a process whose parts have the nature more of physical than chemical elements. In the animate world, the sex relation comes under this schema and it also constitutes the formal basis for the spiritual relations of love, friendship, and the like.<br/><a name="HL3_728a"></a>

Examined more closely the chemical object, as a <i>self-subsistent</i> totality in general, is in the first instance an object that is reflected into itself and to that extent is distinct from its reflectedness outwards — an indifferent <i>base, </i>the individual not yet specified as different; <i>the person, </i>too, is such a base related at first only to itself. But the immanent determinateness which constitutes its <i>difference, </i>is first reflected into itself in such a manner that this retraction of the relation outwards is only formal abstract universality; thus the relation outwards is the determination of its immediacy and concrete existence. From this aspect, it does not <i>in its own self</i> return into the individual totality; and the negative unity has the two moments of its opposition in two <i>particular objects. </i>Accordingly, a chemical object is not comprehensible from itself alone, and the being of one is the being of the other. But secondly, the determinateness is absolutely reflected into itself and is the concrete moment of the individual Notion of the whole, which Notion is the universal essence, the <i>real genus </i>of the particular object. The chemical object, which is thus the contradiction of its immediate positedness and its immanent individual Notion, is a <i>striving </i>to sublate the determinateness of its existence and to give concrete existence to the objective totality of the Notion. Therefore, though it also lacks self-subsistence, it spontaneously tenses itself against this deficiency and initiates the <i>process </i>by its self-determining.<br/>
<a name="HL3_728"></a><a name="1582"></a>
<h4 id="HGL1014">B. THE CHEMICAL PROCESS</h4>

1. It begins with the presupposition that the objects in tension, tensed as they are against themselves, are in the first instance by that very fact just as much tensed against one another — a relationship that is called their <i>affinity. </i>Since each through its Notion stands in contradiction to the one-sidedness of its own existence and consequently strives to sublate it, there is immediately posited in this fact the striving to sublate the one-sidedness of the other object; and through this reciprocal adjustment and combination to posit a reality conformable to the Notion, which contains both moments.<br/><a name="1583"></a>

As each of the objects is posited as self-contradictory and self-sublating in its own self, it is only by an <i>external compulsion</i> [<i>Gewalt</i>] that they are held apart from one another and from their reciprocal integration. Now the middle term whereby these extremes are concluded into a unity is first the <i>implicit </i>nature of both, the whole Notion that holds both within itself. Secondly, however, since in their concrete existence they stand confronting each other, their absolute unity is also a still formal element having <i>an existence distinct </i>from them — the element of <i>communication in</i> which they enter into external <i>community </i>with each other.
<a name="HL3_729"></a>
Since the real difference belongs to the extremes, this middle term is only the abstract neutrality, the real possibility of those extremes; it is, as it were, the <i>theoretical element </i>of the concrete existence of chemical objects, of their process and its result. In the material world <i>water </i>fulfils the function of this medium; in the spiritual world, so far as the analogue of such a relation has a place there, <i>the sign </i>in general, and more precisely <i>language, </i>is to be regarded as fulfilling that function.<br/><a name="1584"></a>

The relationship of the objects, as a mere communication in this element, is on the one hand a quiescent coming-together, but on the other hand it is no less a <i>negative bearing </i>of each to the other; for in communication the concrete Notion which is their nature is posited as a reality, with the result that the <i>real differences </i>of the objects are reduced to <i>its </i>unity. Their previous self-subsistent <i>determinateness </i>is thus sublated in the union that conforms to the Notion, which is one and the same in both, and thereby their opposition and tension are weakened, with the result that in this reciprocal integration the striving reaches its quiescent <i>neutrality</i>.<br/><a name="1585"></a>

The process is in this way <i>extinguished; </i>the contradiction between the Notion and reality being resolved, the extremes of the syllogism have lost their opposition and have thus ceased to be extremes both against each other and against the middle term. The <i>product is neutral, </i>that is, a product in which the ingredients, which can no longer be called objects, have lost their tension and with it those properties which belonged to them as tensed, while the <i>capability </i>of their former self-subsistence and tension is preserved. For the negative unity of the neutral product proceeds from a <i>presupposed </i>difference; the <i>determinateness </i>of the chemical object is identical with its objectivity, it is original. Through the process just considered this difference is as yet only <i>immediately</i> sublated; the determinateness is, therefore, as yet not absolutely reflected into itself, and consequently the product of the process is only a formal unity.<br/><a name="HL3_730"></a>

2. Now in this product, the tension of the opposition and the negative unity, as activity of the process, are indeed extinct. But since this unity is essential to the Notion and has at the same time come into concrete existence, it is still present, though its place is <i>outside </i>the neutral object. The process does not spontaneously re-kindle itself, for it had the difference only for its <i>presupposition</i> and did not itself <i>posit </i>it. This self-subsistent negativity outside the object, the existence of the <i>abstract </i>individuality whose being-for-self has its reality in the <i>indifferent object, </i>is now tensed within itself against its abstraction, and is an inward restless activity that turns outwards to consume. It relates itself <i>immediately </i>to the object whose quiescent neutrality is the real possibility of its opposition; that object is now the <i>middle term </i>of the previously merely formal neutrality, now inwardly concrete and determinate.<br/><a name="1587"></a>

The more precise immediate relation of the <i>extreme of negative unity </i>to the object is that the latter is determined by it and thereby disrupted. This disruption may in the first instance be regarded as the restoration of that opposition of the objects in tension with which chemism began. But this determination does not constitute the other extreme of the syllogism but belongs to the immediate relation of the differentiating principle to the middle term in which this principle gives itself its immediate reality; it is the determinateness that the middle term in the disjunctive syllogism also possesses besides being the universal nature of the object, and by virtue of which the object is both objective universality and also determinate particularity. The <i>other extreme </i>of the syllogism stands opposed to the external <i>self-subsistent extreme </i>of individuality; it is therefore the equally self-subsistent extreme of <i>universality; </i>hence the disruption suffered by the real neutrality of the middle term in this extreme is that it is split up into moments whose relationship is not that of difference, but of <i>indifference. </i>Accordingly these moments are the abstract indifferent <i>base </i>on the one side, and its <i>energising </i>principle on the other, which latter by its separation from the base attains likewise the form of indifferent objectivity.<br/><a name="1588"></a>

This disjunctive syllogism is the totality of chemism in which the same objective whole is exhibited first as self-subsistent <i>negative </i>unity, then in the middle term as real unity, and finally as the chemical reality resolved into its <i>abstract </i>moments. In these latter the determinateness has not reached its <i>reflection-into-self </i>in an other as in the neutral product, but has in itself returned into its abstraction, and is an <i>originally determinate element</i>.<br/><a name="HL3_731a"></a>

3. These elementary objects are accordingly liberated from chemical tension; in them, the original basis of that <i>presupposition</i> with which chemism began has been <i>posited </i>through the real process. Now further, the inner <i>determinateness </i>as such of these objects is essentially the contradiction of their <i>simple indifferent subsistence </i>and themselves as <i>determinateness, </i>and is the urge outwards that sunders itself and posits tension in its object and in <i>another </i>object in order to have something with which it can enter into a relation of difference and in which it can neutralise itself and give to its simple determinateness an existent reality. Consequently, on the one hand chemism has returned into its beginning in which objects in a state of reciprocal tension seek one another and then by a formal, external middle term, unite to form a neutral product. On the other hand, chemism by this return into its <i>Notion </i>sublates itself and has passed over into a higher sphere.<br/><a name="HL3_731"></a><a name="1590"></a>
<h4 id="HGL1015">C. TRANSITION OF CHEMISM</h4>

Even ordinary chemistry shows examples of chemical alterations in which a body, for example, imparts a higher oxidation to one part of its mass and thereby reduces another part to a lower degree of oxidation, in which lower degree alone it can enter into a neutral combination with another [chemically] different body brought into contact with it, a combination for which it would not have been receptive in that first immediate degree. What happens here is that the object does not relate itself to another in accordance with an immediate, one-sided determinateness, but that in accordance with the inner totality of an original <i>relation it posits the presupposition </i>which it requires for a real relation and thereby gives itself a middle term through which it unites its Notion with its reality; it is absolutely determined individuality, the concrete Notion as principle of the <i>disjunction into extremes whose re-union</i> is the activity of <i>the same </i>negative principle, which thereby returns to its first determination, but returns <i>objectified</i>.<br/><a name="HL3_732"></a>

Chemism itself is <i>the first negation of indifferent </i>objectivity and of the <i>externality </i>of determinateness; it is therefore still infected with the immediate self-subsistence of the object and with externality. Consequently it is not yet for itself that totality of self-determination that proceeds from it and in which rather it is sublated. The three syllogisms yielded by the foregoing exposition constitute its totality; the first has for middle term formal neutrality and for extremes the objects in tension; the second has for middle term the product of the first, real neutrality, and for extremes the sundering activity and its product, the indifferent element; while the third is the self-realising Notion, which posits for itself the presupposition by which the process of its realisation is conditioned — a syllogism that has the universal for its essence. On account, however, of the immediacy and externality attaching to chemical objectivity, <i>these syllogisms still fall apart. </i>The first process whose product is the neutrality of the objects in tension is extinguished in its product, and it is an externally applied differentiation that re-kindles it; conditioned by an immediate presupposition, it exhausts itself in it. Similarly, the separation of the [chemically] different extremes out of the neutral product, as also their decomposition into their abstract elements, must proceed from <i>conditions </i>and stimulations of activity <i>externally brought into play. </i>Also, although the two essential moments of the process, on the one side neutralisation, on the other separation and reduction, are combined in one and the same process, and the union of the extremes by weakening of the tension between them is also <i>a sundering </i>into such extremes, yet on account of the still underlying externality they constitute <i>two different </i>sides; the extremes that are separated in that same process are different objects or materials from those that unite in it; in so far as the former emerge again from the process as [chemically] different they must turn outwards; their new neutralisation is a different process from the neutralisation that took place in the first process.<br/><a name="1592"></a>

But these various processes, which have proved themselves necessary, are so many stages by which <i>externality and conditionedness </i>are sublated and from which the Notion emerges as a totality determined in and for itself and not conditioned by externality. In the first process, the mutual externality of the different extremes that constitute the whole reality, or the distinction between the <i>implicitly </i>determinate Notion and its <i>existent </i>determinateness, is sublated; in the second, the externality of the real unity, the union as merely <i>neutral, </i>is sublated; more precisely, the formal activity in the first instance sublates itself in equally formal bases or indifferent determinatenesses, whose <i>inner Notion</i> is now the indrawn absolute activity as inwardly self-realising, that is, the activity that <i>posits </i>the determinate differences within itself and through this mediation constitutes itself as real unity — a mediation which is thus the Notion's own mediation, its self-determination, and in respect of its reflection thence into itself, an immanent <i>presupposing. </i>The third syllogism, which on the one hand is the restoration of the preceding processes, on the other hand sublates the last remaining moment of <i>indifferent </i>bases the wholly abstract external <i>immediacy, </i>which in this way becomes the Notion's own moment of self-mediation. The Notion which has thus sublated all the moments of its objective existence as external, and posited them within its simple unity, is thereby completely liberated from objective externality, to which it relates itself only as to an unessential reality. This objective free Notion is end. <br/>
