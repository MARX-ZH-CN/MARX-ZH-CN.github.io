The purpose of the Cambridge Hegel Translations is to offer translations of the best modern German editions of Hegel's work in a uniform format suitable for Hegel scholars, together with philosophical introductions and full editorial apparatus.<br/>
Hegel's <i>Encyclopedia</i> Logic constitutes the foundation of the system of philosophy presented in his <i>Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences</i>. Together with his <i>Science of Logic</i>, it contains the most explicit formulation of his enduringly influential dialectical method and of the categorial system underlying his thought. It offers a more compact presentation of his dialectical method than is found elsewhere, and also incorporates changes that he would have made to the second edition of the <i>Science of Logic</i>, if he had lived to do so. This volume presents it in a new translation with a helpful introduction, an extended analytical index, and notes. It will be a valuable reference work for scholars and students of Hegel and German idealism, as well as for those who are interested in the post-Hegelian aspects of contemporary philosophy.<br/>
